women I ever came across, you are the
worst. I believe you'd raise a riot in the cemetry
if you were dead, you would. Don't you ever go
prowling around any Quaker meeting, or you'll
break it up in a plug muss. You? Why you'd
put any other man's back up until he broke his
spine. Oh! you're too annoying to live; I don't
want to bother with you. Go to sleep.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Mrs. Wilkins.</span> &nbsp;&nbsp;But, Wilkins dear, just listen
a minute. We must have that piano, and&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="sc">Mr. W.</span> &nbsp;&nbsp;Oh! don't "dear" me; I won't have
it. You're the only dear thing around here&mdash;you're
dear at any price. I tell you once for all that I
don't get any new piano, and Mary Jane don't
take singing lessons as long as I'm her father.
There! If you don't understand that I'll say it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page8" id="page8"></a>[page&nbsp;8]</span>
over again. And now stop your clatter and go
to sleep; I'm tired of hearing you cackle.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Mrs. W.</span> &nbsp;&nbsp;But, Wilk&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="sc">Mr. W.</span> &nbsp;&nbsp;Now don't aggravate me. I say
Mary Jane shan't learn to sing and plant another
instrument of torture in this house, while I'm boss
of the family. Her voice is just like yours; it's
got a twang to it like blowing on the edge of a
piece of paper.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Mrs. W.</span> &nbsp;&nbsp;Ain't you ashamed, Wilk&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="sc">Mr. W.</span> &nbsp;&nbsp;It's disgrace enough to have <i>you</i> sitting
down and pretending to sing, and trying to deafen
people, without having the children do it. The
first time I heard you sing I started round to the
station-house and got six policemen, because I
thought there was a murder in your house, and
they were cutting you up by inches. I wish somebody
would! I wouldn't go for any policeman
now, not much!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Mrs. W.</span> &nbsp;&nbsp;I declare, you are a perfect brute!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Mr. W.</span> &nbsp;&nbsp;Not much, I wouldn't! But Smith, he
told me yesterday that his family were kept awake
half the night by the noise you made; and he said
if I didn't stop those dogs from yowling in my
cellar, he'd be obliged to complain to the board
of health.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Mrs. W.</span> &nbsp;&nbsp;What an awful story, Mr Wilk&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="sc">Mr. W.</span> &nbsp;&nbsp;Then I told him it was you, and you
thought you could sing; and he advised me as
a friend to get a divorce, because he said no man
could live happily with any woman who had a
voice like a cross-cut saw. He said I might as
well have a machine-shop with a lot of files at work
in my house as that, and he'd rather any time.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Mrs. W.</span> &nbsp;&nbsp;Phugh! I don't care what Smith
says.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Mr. W.</span> &nbsp;&nbsp;And you a-talking about a new piano!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page9" id="page9"></a>[page&nbsp;9]</span>
Why, haven't we got musical instruments enough
in the house? There's Holofernes Montgomery
been blowing away in the garret for ten days with
that old key bugle, until he got so black in the
face that he won't get his colour back for a month,
and then he only gets a spurt out of her every now
and then. He's blown enough wind in her to get
up a hurricane, and I expect nothing else but he'll
get the old machine so chock full that she'll blow
back at him some day and burst his brains out,
and all along of your tomfoolery. You're a pretty
mother, you are! You'd better go and join some
asylum for feeble-minded idiots, you had.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Mrs. W.</span> &nbsp;&nbsp;Wilkins! I declare you're too bad,
for&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="sc">Mr. W.</span> &nbsp;&nbsp;Yes&mdash;and there's Bucephalus Alexander,
he's got his head full of your sentimental
nonsense, and he thinks he's in love with a girl
round the corner, and he meanders about and
tries to sigh, and won't eat his victuals, and he's
got to going down into the cellar and trying to
sing "No one to love" in the coal-bin; and he
like to scared the hired girl out of her senses, so
that she went upstairs and had a fit on the kitchen
door-mat, and came near dying on my hands.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Mrs. W.</span> &nbsp;&nbsp;That's not true, Mr. Wil&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="sc">Mr. W.</span> &nbsp;&nbsp;And never came to until I put her
head under the hydrant. And then what does
Bucephalus Alexander do but go round, night
before last, and try to serenade the girl, until the
old man histed up the sash and cracked away at
Bucephalus Alexander with an old boot, and hit him
in the face and blacked his eye, because he thought
it was two cats a-yelping. Hang such a mother
as you are! You go right to work to ruin your
offspring.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Mrs. W.</span> &nbsp;&nbsp;You're talking nonsense, Wilk&mdash;</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page10" id="page10"></a>[page&nbsp;10]</span>

<p><span class="sc">Mr. W.</span> &nbsp;&nbsp;You're about as fit to bring up children
as a tadpole is to run a ferry boat, you are! But
while I'm alive Mary Jane takes no singing lessons.
Do you understand? It's bad enough to have her
battering away at that piano like she had some
grudge against it, and to have her visitors wriggle
around and fidget and look miserable, as if they
had cramp colic, while you make her play for them
and have them get up and lie, and ask what it was,
and say how beautiful it is, and steep their souls in
falsehood and hypocrisy all on account of you.
You'll have enough sins to answer for, old woman,
without that.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Mrs. W.</span> &nbsp;&nbsp;I never did such a thing, and you&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="sc">Mr. W.</span> &nbsp;&nbsp;Yes&mdash;and you think Mary Jane can
play, don't you? You think she can sit down and
jerk more music than a whole orchestra, don't you?
But she can't. You might about as well set a
crowbar to opening oysters as set her to playing
on that piano. You might, indeed!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Mrs. W.</span> &nbsp;&nbsp;You talk like a fool, Wilkins!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Mr. W.</span> &nbsp;&nbsp;Play! She play? Pshaw! Why, she's
drummed away at that polka for six months and
she can't get her grip on it yet. You might as well
try to sing a long-metre hymn to "Fisher's Hornpipe,"
as to undertake to dance to that polka. It
would jerk your legs out at the sockets, certain, or
else it would give you St. Vitus' dance, and cripple
you for life.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Mrs. W.</span> &nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Wilkins, I'm going to tell you
a secret.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Mr. W.</span> &nbsp;&nbsp;Oh! I don't want to hear your secrets&mdash;keep
them to yourself.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Mrs. W.</span> &nbsp;&nbsp;It's about Mary Jane's singing.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Mr. W.</span> &nbsp;&nbsp;What?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Mrs. W.</span> &nbsp;&nbsp;Mary Jane, you know&mdash;her singing.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page11" id="page11"></a>[page&nbsp;11]</span>

<p><span class="sc">Mr. W.</span> &nbsp;&nbsp;I don't know, and I don't want to;
she shan't take lessons, so dry up.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Mrs. W.</span> &nbsp;&nbsp;But she shall take them!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Mr. W.</span> &nbsp;&nbsp;I say she shan't!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Mrs. W.</span> &nbsp;&nbsp;She shall, and you can't help it.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Mr. W.</span> &nbsp;&nbsp;By George! What do you mean? I'm
master in this house I'd like you to know.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Mrs. W.</span> &nbsp;&nbsp;Yes&mdash;but she's been taking lessons
for a whole quarter, while you were down town,
and I paid the bill out of the market money.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Mr. W.</span> &nbsp;&nbsp;Well! I hope I may be shot! You
don't mean to say that? Well, if you ain't a
perfectly abandoned wretch, hang me! Farewell,
Mrs. Wilkins, farewell! I'm off by the first express-train
for the West! I'll stop at Chicago, where the
cars wait fifteen minutes for refreshments and a
divorce&mdash;I'll take the divorce, that will be indeed
refreshing! Farewell! F-a-r-e-well! Fare-r-r-r-r-r-r-well!
Mrs. Wil-l-l-l-l-l-l-kins!</p>

<h2>SNYDER'S NOSE.</h2>

<p class="indright"><b>"OUR FAT CONTRIBUTOR."</b></p>

<p class="dropcap" ><span class="dcap">S</span>
<b>NYDER</b> kept a beer saloon some years ago "over
the Rhine." Snyder was a ponderous Teuton of
very irascible temper&mdash;"sudden and quick in
quarrel"&mdash;get mad in a minute. Nevertheless his
saloon was a great resort for "the boys"&mdash;partly
because of the excellence of his beer, and partly
because they liked to chafe "Old Snyder," as they
called him; for, although his bark was terrific,
experience had taught them that he wouldn't bite.</p>

<p>One day Snyder was missing; and it was explained
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page14" id="page14"></a>[page&nbsp;14]</span>
by his "frau," who "jerked" the beer that day,
that he had "gone out fishing mit der poys." The
next day one of the boys, who was particularly fond
of "roasting" old Snyder, dropped in to get a glass
of beer, and discovered Snyder's nose, which was a
big one at any time, swollen and blistered by the
sun, until it looked like a dead-ripe tomato.</p>

<p>"Why, Snyder, what's the matter with your
nose?" said the caller.</p>

<p>"I peen out fishing mit der poys," replied Snyder,
laying his finger tenderly against his proboscis;
"the sun it pese hot like ash never vas, und I purns
my nose. Nice nose, don't it?" And Snyder viewed
it with a look of comical sadness in the little mirror
back of his bar. It entered at once into the head of
the mischievous fellow in front of the bar to play a
joke upon Snyder; so he went out and collected half
a dozen of his comrades, with whom he arranged that
they should drop in at the saloon one after another,
and ask Snyder, "What's the matter with that
nose?" to see how long he would stand it. The man
who put up the job went in first with a companion,
and seating themselves at a table called for beer.
Snyder brought it to them, and the new-comer
exclaimed as he saw him, "Snyder, what's the
matter with your nose?"</p>

<p>"I yust dell your friend here I peen out fishin' mit
der poys, unt de sun he purnt 'em&mdash;zwi lager&mdash;den
cents&mdash;all right."</p>

<p>Another boy rushes in. "Halloo, boys, you're
ahead of me this time; s'pose I'm in, though. Here,
Snyder, bring me a glass of lager and a pret"&mdash;(appears
to catch a sudden glimpse of Snyder's nose,
looks wonderingly a moment and then bursts out
laughing)&mdash;"ha! ha! ha! Why, Snyder&mdash;ha!&mdash;ha!&mdash;what's
the matter with that nose?"</p>

<p>Snyder, of course, can't see any fun in having a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page15" id="page15"></a>[page&nbsp;15]</span>
burnt nose or having it laughed at; and he says, in
a tone sternly emphatic:</p>

<p>"I peen out fishin' mit der poys, unt de sun it yust
ash hot ash blazes, unt I purnt my nose; dat ish all
right."</p>

<p>Another tormentor comes in, and insists on "setting
'em up" for the whole house. "Snyder," says
he, "fill up the boys' glasses, and take a drink
yourse&mdash;&mdash;ho! ho! ho! ho! ha! ha! ha! Snyder,
wha&mdash;ha! ha!&mdash;what's the matter with that nose?"</p>

<p>Snyder's brow darkens with wrath by this time, and
his voice grows deeper and sterner:</p>

<p>"I peen out fishin' mit der poys on the Leedle
Miami. De sun pese hot like ash&mdash;vel, I burn my
pugle. Now that is more vot I don't got to say.
Vot gind o' peseness? Dat ish all right; I purn my
<i>own</i> nose, don't it?"</p>

<p>"Burn your nose&mdash;burn all the hair off your head
for what I care; you needn't get mad about it."</p>

<p>It was evident that <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Snider'">Snyder</ins> wouldn't stand more
than one tweak at that nose; for he was tramping
about behind his bar, and growling like an exasperated
old bear in his cage. Another one of
his tormentors walks in. Some one sings out to
him, "Have a glass of beer, Billy?"</p>

<p>"Don't care about any beer," says Billy, "but,
Snyder, you may give me one of your best ciga&mdash;Ha-a-a!
ha! ha! ha! ho! ho! ho! he! he! he!
ah-h-h-ha! ha! ha! ha! Why&mdash;why&mdash;Snyder&mdash;who
who&mdash;ha-ha! ha! what's the matter with that
nose?"</p>

<p>Snyder was absolutely fearful to behold by this time;
his face was purple with rage, all except his
nose, which glowed like a ball of fire. Leaning his
ponderous figure far over the bar, and raising his arm
aloft to emphasize his words with it, he fairly roared:</p>

<p>"I peen out fishin' mit ter poys. The sun it pese
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page16" id="page16"></a>[page&nbsp;16]</span>
hot like ash never was. I purnt my nose. Now you
no like dose nose, you yust take dose nose unt wr-wr-wr-wring
your mean American finger mit 'em. That's
the kind of man vot I am!" And Snyder was right.</p>

<h2>THE MISER'S FATE.</h2>

<p class="indright"><b>OSBORNE.</b></p>


<blockquote><p>
In the year 1762 a miser, of the name of Foscue, in France, having
amassed enormous wealth by habits of extortion and the most sordid
parsimony, was requested by the government to advance a sum of money
as a loan. The miser demurred, pretending that he was poor. In order to
hide his gold effectually, he dug a deep cave in his cellar, the descent to
which was by a ladder, and which was entered by means of a trap-door, to
which was attached a spring-lock.</p>

<p>He entered this cave one day to gloat over his gold, when the door fell
upon him, and the spring-lock, the key to which he had left on the outside,
snapped, and held him a prisoner in the cave, where he perished miserably.
Some months afterwards a search was made, and his body was found in the
midst of his money-bags, with a candlestick lying beside it on the floor. In
the following lines the miser is supposed to have just entered his cave, and
to be soliloquizing.

<p>His breech&mdash;ah! forgive me&mdash;I meant pantaloon;</p>
<p class="i4">And miraculously did they fit her.</p>
<p>The Lodge was at work on the Master's Degree;</p>
<p>The light was ablaze on the letter G;</p>
<p>High soared the pillars J. and B.;</p>
<p>The officers sat like Solomon, wise;</p>
<p>The brimstone burned amid horrid cries;</p>
<p>The goat roamed wildly through the room;</p>
<p>The candidate begged 'em to let him go home;</p>
<p>And the devil himself stood up in the east,</p>
<p>As proud as an alderman at a feast;&mdash;</p>
<p class="i4">When in came Mrs. Byrde.</p>
<p>Oh, horrible sounds! oh, horrible sight!</p>
<p>Can it be that Masons take delight</p>
<p>In spending thus the hours of night?</p>
<p>Ah! could their wives and daughters know</p>
<p>The unutterable things they say and do,</p>
<p>Their feminine hearts would burst with woe;</p>
<p class="i4">But this is not all my story,</p>
<p>For those Masons joined in a hideous ring,</p>
<p>The candidate howling like everything,</p>
<p>And thus in tones of death they sing</p>
<p class="i4">(The Candidate's name was Morey):</p>
<p>"Blood to drink and bones to crack,</p>
<p>Skulls to smash and lives to take,</p>
<p>Hearts to crush and souls to burn&mdash;</p>
<p>Give old Morey another turn,</p>
<p class="i4">And make him all grim and gory."</p>
<p>Trembling with horror stood Mrs. Byrde,</p>
<p>Unable to speak a single word;</p>
<p>She staggered and fell in the nearest chair,</p>
<p>On the left of the Junior Warden there,</p>
<p>And scarcely noticed, so loud the groans,</p>
<p>That the chair was made of human bones.</p>
<p>Of human bones! on grinning skulls</p>
<p>That ghastly throne of horror rolls&mdash;</p>
<p>Those skulls, the skulls that Morgan bore!</p>
<p>Those bones the bones that Morgan wore!</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page20" id="page20"></a>[page&nbsp;20]</span>
<p>His scalp across the top was flung,</p>
<p>His teeth around the arms were strung&mdash;</p>
<p>Never in all romance was known</p>
<p>Such uses made of human bone.</p>
<p>The brimstone gleamed in lurid flame,</p>
<p>Just like a place we will not name;</p>
<p>Good angels, that inquiring came</p>
<p>From blissful courts, looked on with shame</p>
<p class="i4">And tearful melancholy.</p>
<p>Again they dance, but twice as bad,</p>
<p>They jump and sing like demons mad;</p>
<p class="i4">The tune is Hunkey Dorey&mdash;</p>
<p>"Blood to drink," etc., etc.</p>
<p>Then came a pause&mdash;a pair of paws</p>
<p>Reached through the floor, up sliding doors,</p>
<p>And grabbed the unhappy candidate!</p>
<p>How can I without tears relate</p>
<p>The lost and ruined Morey's fate?</p>
<p>She saw him sink in a fiery hole,</p>
<p>She heard him scream, "My soul! my soul!"</p>
<p>While roars of fiendish laughter roll,</p>
<p class="i4">And drown the yells of mercy!</p>
<p>"Blood to drink," etc., etc.</p>
<p>The ridiculous woman could stand no more&mdash;</p>
<p>She fainted and fell on the checkered floor,</p>
<p>'Midst all the diabolical roar.</p>
<p>What then, you ask me, did befall</p>
<p>Mehitable Byrde? Why, nothing at all&mdash;</p>
<p><i>She had dreamed</i> she'd been in the Masons' hall.</p>

<h2>PAT AND THE FOX.</h2>

<p class="indright"><b>SAMUEL LOVER.</b></p>

<p style="line-height: 1%; margin-top: -0.5em;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="dropcap" ><span class="dcap">P
<b>addy</b></span>," said the squire, "perhaps you would
favor the gentleman with that story you told
me once about a fox?"</p>

<p>"Indeed and I will, plaze yer honor," said Paddy,
"though I know full well the divil a one word iv it
you b'lieve, nor the gintlemen won't either, though
you're axin' me for it&mdash;but only want to laugh at me,
and call me a big liar when my back's turned."</p>

<p>"Maybe we wouldn't wait for your back being
turned, Paddy, to honor you with that title."</p>

<p>"Oh, indeed, I'm not sayin' that you wouldn't do
it as soon foreninst my face, yer honor, as you often
did before, and will agin, plaze God, and welkim."</p>

<p>"Well, Paddy, say no more about that, but let's
have the story."</p>

<p>"Sure I'm losing no time, only telling the gintlemen
beforehand that it's what they'll be callin' it, a
lie&mdash;and indeed it's ancommon, sure enough; but
you see, gintlemen, you must remimber that the fox
is the cunnin'est baste in the world, barrin' the
wran&mdash;&mdash;"</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page23" id="page23"></a>[page&nbsp;23]</span>

<p>Here Paddy was questioned why he considered the
wren as cunning a <i>baste</i> as the fox.</p>

<p>"Why, sir, bekase all the birds build their nest
wid one hole to it only, excep'n the wran; but the
wran builds two holes to the nest, and so that if any
inimy comes to disturb it upon one door it can go out
an the other. But the fox is cute to that degree
that there's many mortial a fool to him&mdash;and, by
dad, the fox could by and sell many a Christian, as
you'll soon see by-and-by, when I tell you what happened
to a wood-ranger that I knew wanst, and a dacent
man he was, and wouldn't say the thing in a lie.</p>

<p>"Well, you see, he kem home one night mighty
tired&mdash;for he was out wid a party in the domain
cock-shootin' that day; and whin he got back to his
lodge he threw a few logs o' wood an the fire to
make himself comfortable, and he tuk whatever little
matther he had for his supper&mdash;and afther that he
felt himself so tired that he wint to bed. But you're
to understand that, though he wint to bed, it was
more for to rest himself like, than to sleep, for it was
airly; and so he jist wint into bed, and there he
divarted himself lookin' at the fire, that was blazin'
as merry as a bonfire an the hearth.</p>

<p>"Well, as he was lyin' that-a-way, jist thinkin' o'
nothin' at all, what should come into the place but a
fox. But I must tell you, what I forgot to tell you,
before, that the ranger's house was on the bordhers
o' the wood, and he had no one to live wid him but
himself, barrin' the dogs that he had the care iv, that
was his only companions, and he had a hole cut
an the door, with a swingin' boord to it, that the
dogs might go in or out accordin' as it plazed thim;
and, by dad, the fox kem in as I told you, through
the hole in the door, as bould as a ram, and walked
over to the fire, and sat down foreninst it.</p>

<p>"Now it was mighty provokin' that all the dogs
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page24" id="page24"></a>[page&nbsp;24]</span>
was out; they wor rovin' about the wood, you see,
lookin for to catch rabbits to ate, or some other
mischief, and so it happened that there wasn't as
much as one individual dog in the place; and, by
gor, I'll go bail the fox knew that right well before
he put his nose inside the ranger's lodge.</p>

<p>"Well, the ranger was in hopes some o' the dogs
id come home and ketch the chap, and he was loath
to stir hand or fut himself, afeared o' frightenin'
away the fox, but by gor, he could hardly keep his
timper at all at all, whin he seen the fox take his
pipe aff o' the hob where he left it afore he wint to
bed, and puttin' the bowl o' the pipe into the fire to
kindle it (it's as thrue as I'm here), he began to
smoke foreninst the fire, as nath'ral as any other
man you ever seen.</p>

<p>"'Musha, bad luck to your impidence, you long-tailed
blackguard,' says the ranger, 'and is it
smokin' my pipe you are? Oh, thin, by this and by
that, iv I had my gun convaynient to me, it's fire and
smoke of another sort, and what you wouldn't
bargain for, I'd give you,' says he. But still he was
loath to stir, hopin the dogs id come home; and
'By gor, my fine fellow,' says he to the fox, 'if one
o' the dogs comes home, saltpethre wouldn't save
you, and that's a sthrong pickle.'</p>

<p>"So with that he watched antil the fox wasn't
mindin' him, but was busy shakin' the cindhers out
o' the pipe whin he was done wid it, and so the
ranger thought he was goin' to go immediately
afther gettin an air o' the fire and a shough o' the
pipe; and so, says he, 'Faix, my lad, I won't let you
go so aisy as all that, as cunnin' as you think yourself;'
and with that he made a dart out o' bed, and
run over to the door, and got betune it and the fox,
'And now,' says he, 'your bread's baked, my buck,
and maybe my lord won't have a fine run out o' you,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page25" id="page25"></a>[page&nbsp;25]</span>
and the dogs at your brish every yard, you morodin'
thief, and the divil mind you,' says he, 'for your
impidence&mdash;for sure, if you hadn't the impidence of
a highwayman's horse it's not into my very house,
undher my nose, you'd daar for to come:' and with
that he began to whistle for the dogs; and the fox,
that stood eyein' him all the time while he was
spakin', began to think it was time to be joggin'
whin he heard the whistle&mdash;and says the fox to himself,
'Troth, indeed, you think yourself a mighty
great ranger now,' says he, 'and you think you're
very cute, but upon my tail, and that's a big oath,
I'd be long sorry to let such a mallet-headed bog-throtter
as yourself take a dirty advantage o' me,
and I'll engage,' says the fox, 'I'll make you lave
the door soon and suddint,'&mdash;and with that he turned
to where the ranger's brogues was lyin' hard by
beside the fire, and, what would you think, but the
fox tuk one o' the brogues, and wint over to the fire,
and threw it into it.</p>

<p>"'I think that'll make you start,' says the fox.</p>

<p>"'Divil resave the start,' says the ranger&mdash;'that
won't do, my buck,' says he, 'the brogue may burn
to cindhers,' says he, 'but out o' this I won't stir;'
and thin, puttin' his fingers into his mouth, he gev a
blast of a whistle you'd hear a mile off, and shouted
for the dogs.</p>

<p>"'So that won't do,' says the fox&mdash;'well, I must
thry another offer,' says he, and with that he tuk up
the other brogue, and threw it into the fire too.</p>

<p>"'There, now,' says he, 'you may keep the other
company,' says he; 'and there's a pair o' you now,
as the divil said to his knee-buckles.'</p>

<p>"'Oh, you thievin' varment,' says the ranger,
'you won't lave me a tack to my feet; but no
matter,' says he, 'your head's worth more nor a pair
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page26" id="page26"></a>[page&nbsp;26]</span>
o' brogues to me any day, and by the Piper of
Blessintown, you're money in my pocket this minit,'
says he: and with that, the fingers was in his mouth
agin, and he was goin' to whistle, whin, what would
you think, but up sets the fox on his hunkers, and
puts his two fore-paws into his mouth, makin' game
o' the ranger&mdash;(bad luck to the lie I tell you.)</p>

<p>"'Well, the ranger, and no wondher, although in
a rage as he was, couldn't help laughin' at the
thought o' the fox mockin' him, and, by dad, he tuk
sitch a fit o' laughin' that he couldn't whistle&mdash;and
that was the 'cuteness o' the fox to gain time; but
whin his first laugh was over, the ranger recovered
himself, and gev another whistle; and so says the
fox, 'By my soul,' says he, 'I think it wouldn't be
good for my health to stay here much longer, and I
mustn't be triflin' with that blackguard ranger any
more,' says he, 'and I must make him sensible that
it is time to let me go, and though he hasn't
understandin' to be sorry for his brogues, I'll go bail
I'll make him lave that,' says he, 'before he'd say
<i>sparables</i>'&mdash;and with that what do you think the fox
done? By all that's good&mdash;and the ranger himself
told me out iv his own mouth, and said he would
never have b'lieved it, ownly he seen it&mdash;the fox tuk
a lighted piece iv a log out o' the blazin' fire, and
run over wid it to the ranger's bed, and was goin' to
throw it into the sthraw, and burn him out of house
and home; so when the ranger seen that he gev a
shout out iv him&mdash;</p>

<p>"'Hillo! hillo! you murtherin' villain,' says he,
'you're worse nor Captain Rock; is it goin' to burn
me out you are, you red rogue iv a Ribbonman?"
and he made a dart betune him and the bed, to save
the house from bein' burnt,&mdash;but, my jew'l, that was
all the fox wanted&mdash;and as soon as the ranger
quitted the hole in the door that he was standin'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page27" id="page27"></a>[page&nbsp;27]</span>
foreninst, the fox let go the blazin' faggit, and made
one jump through the door and escaped.</p>

<p>"But before he wint, the ranger gev me his oath
that the fox turned round and gev him the most
contemptible look he ever got in his life, and showed
every tooth in his head with laughin', and at last he
put out his tongue at him, as much as to say&mdash;'You've
missed me like your mammy's blessin',' and
off wid him, like a flash o' lightnin'."</p>

<h2>WHAT AILED "UGLY SAM."</h2>

<p class="indright"><b>DETROIT FREE PRESS.</b></p>

<p style="line-height: 1%; margin-top: -0.5em;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="dropcap" ><span class="dcap">H</span>
<b>E</b> had been missing from the "Potomac" for
several days, and Cleveland Tom, Port Huron
Bill, Tall Chicago, and the rest of the boys who were
wont to get drunk with him, couldn't make out what
had happened. They hadn't heard that there was
a warrant out for him, had never known of his being
sick for a day, and his absence from the old haunts
puzzled them. They were in the Hole-in-the-Wall
saloon yesterday morning, nearly a dozen of them,
drinking, smoking, and playing cards, when in
walked Ugly Sam.</p>

<p>There was a deep silence for a moment as they
looked at him. Sam had a new hat, had been
shaved clean, had on a clean collar and a white
shirt, and they didn't know him at first. When
they saw that it was Ugly Sam, they uttered a shout
and leaped up.</p>

<p>"Cave in that hat!" cried one.</p>

<p>"Yank that collar off!" shouted another.</p>

<p>"Let's roll him on the floor!" screamed a third.</p>

<p>There was something in his look and bearing
which made them hesitate. The whiskey-red had
almost faded from his face, and he looked sober
and dignified. His features expressed disgust and
contempt as he looked around the room, and then
revealed pity as his eyes fell upon the red eyes and
bloated faces of the crowd before him.</p>

<p>"Why, what ails ye, Sam?" inquired Tall
Chicago, as they all stood there.</p>

<p>"I've come down to bid ye good-bye, boys!" he
replied, removing his hat and drawing a clean
handkerchief from his pocket.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page30" id="page30"></a>[page&nbsp;30]</span>

<p>"What! Hev ye turned preacher?" they shouted
in chorus.</p>

<p>"Boys, ye know I can lick any two of ye; but I
hain't on the fight any more, an' I've put down the
last drop of whiskey which is ever to go into my
mouth! I've switched off. I've taken an oath.
I'm going to be decent!"</p>

<p>"Sam, be you crazy?" asked Port Huron Bill,
coming nearer to him.</p>

<p>"I've come down here to tell ye all about it,"
answered Sam. "Move the cha'rs back a little and
give me room. Ye all know I've been rough, and
more too. I've been a drinker, a fighter, a gambler,
and a loafer. I can't look back and remember
when I've earned an honest dollar. The police hez
chased me around like a wolf, and I've been in jail
and the work-house, and the papers has said that
Ugly Sam was the terror of the Potomac. Ye all
know this, boys, but ye didn't know I had an old
mother."</p>

<p>The faces of the crowd expressed amazement.</p>

<p>"I never mentioned it to any of ye, for I was
neglecting her," he went on. "She was a poor
old body living up here in the alley, and if the
neighbours hadn't helped her to fuel and food, she'd
have been found dead long ago. I never helped
her to a cent&mdash;didn't see her for weeks and weeks,
and I used to feel mean about it. When a feller
goes back on his old mother, he's a-gittin' purty
low, and I know it. Well, she's dead&mdash;buried
yesterday! I was up there afore she died. She
sent for me by Pete, and when I got there I seen it
was all day with her."</p>

<p>"Did she say anything?" asked one of the boys,
as Sam hesitated.</p>

<p>"That's what ails me now," he went on.
"When I went she reached out her hand to me,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page31" id="page31"></a>[page&nbsp;31]</span>
and says she, 'Samuel, I'm going to die, and I
know'd you'd want to see me afore I passed away!'
I sat down, feeling queer like. She didn't go on
and say as how I was a loafer, and had neglected
her, and all that, but says she, 'Samuel, you'll
be all alone when I'm gone. I've tried to be a
good mother to you, and have prayed for you
hundreds o' nights and cried about you till my
old heart was sore!' Some o' the neighbours had
dropped in, and the women were crying, and I tell
you, boys, I felt weak."</p>

<p>He paused for a moment, and then continued:</p>

<p>"And the old woman said she'd like to kiss me
afore death came, and that broke me right down.
She kept hold of my hand, and by-and-by she
whispered; 'Samuel, you are throwing your life
away. You've got it in you to be a man if you will
only make up your mind, I hate to die and feel
that my only son and the last of our family may go
to the gallows. If I had your promise that you'd
turn over a new leaf and try and be good, it seems
as if I'd die easier. Won't you promise me, my
son?' And I promised her, boys, and that's what
ails me! She died holding my hand, and I promised
to quit this low business and go to work. I
came down to tell ye, and now you won't see me

<p>There was a dead silence for a moment, and then
he said:</p>

<p>"Well, boys, I'll shake hands with ye all around
afore I go. Good-by, Pete&mdash;good-by, Jack&mdash;Tom&mdash;Jim.
I hope you won't fling any bricks at me,
and I shan't never fling any at any of ye. It's
a dying promise, ye see, and I'll keep it if it
takes a right arm!"</p>

admiration and defiance. The student should read, and re-read

<div class="figleft3">
O</div> <br style="line-height: 30%" />
<p class="i4">&nbsp;<b>THOU</b>, that, with surpassing glory crown'd,</p>
<p class="i6">Look'st from thy sole dominion like the God</p>
<p>Of this new world; at whose sight all the stars</p>
<p>Hide their diminish'd heads; to thee I call,</p>
<p>But with no friendly voice, and add thy name,</p>
<p>O Sun! to tell thee how I hate thy beams,</p>
<p>That bring to my remembrance from what state</p>
<p>I fell, how glorious once above thy sphere;</p>
<p>Till pride and worse ambition threw me down</p>
<p>Warring in Heaven against Heaven's matchless king:</p>
<p>Ah, wherefore! he deserved no such return</p>
<p>From me, whom he created what I was</p>
<p>In that bright eminence, and with his good</p>
<p>Upbraided none; nor was his service hard.</p>
<p>What could be less than to afford him praise,</p>
<p>The easiest recompense, and pay him thanks,</p>
<p>How due! yet all his good proved ill in me,</p>
<p>And wrought but malice; lifted up so high</p>
<p>I 'sdain'd subjection, and thought one step higher</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page33" id="page33"></a>[page&nbsp;33]</span>
<p>Would set me highest, and in a moment quit</p>
<p>The debt immense of endless gratitude</p>
<p>So burdensome still paying, still to owe:</p>
<p>Forgetful what from him I still received,</p>
<p>And understood not that a grateful mind</p>
<p>By owing owes not, but still pays, at once</p>
<p>Indebted and discharged; what burden then?</p>
<p>O, had his powerful destiny ordain'd</p>
<p>Me some inferior angel, I had stood</p>
<p>Then happy; no unbounded hope had raised</p>
<p>Ambition! Yet why not? some other Power</p>
<p>As great might have aspired, and me, though mean,</p>
<p>Drawn to his part; but other Powers as great</p>
<p>Fell not, but stand unshaken, from within</p>
<p>Or from without, to all temptations arm'd.</p>
<p>Hadst thou the same free will and power to stand?</p>
<p>Thou hadst: whom hast thou then or what to accuse</p>
<p>But Heaven's free love dealt equally to all?</p>
<p>Be then his love accursed, since love or hate,</p>
<p>To me alike, it deals eternal woe.</p>
<p>Nay, cursed be thou; since against his thy will</p>
<p>Chose freely what it now so justly rues.</p>
<p>Me miserable! which way shall I fly</p>
<p>Infinite wrath and infinite despair?</p>
<p>Which way I fly is hell; myself am hell;</p>
<p>And, in the lowest deep, a lower deep</p>
<p>Still threat'ning to devour me opens wide,</p>
<p>To which the hell I suffer seems a heaven.</p>
<p>O then at last relent: Is there no place</p>
<p>Left for repentance, none for pardon left?</p>
<p>None left but by submission; and that word</p>
<p>Disdain forbids me, and my dread of shame</p>
<p>Among the spirits beneath, whom I seduced</p>
<p>With other promises and other vaunts</p>
<p>Than to submit, boasting I could subdue</p>
<p>The Omnipotent. Ah me! they little know</p>
<p>How dearly I abide that boast so vain,</p>
<p>Under what torments inwardly I groan,</p>
<p>While they adore me on the throne of hell.</p>
<p>With diadem and sceptre high advanced,</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page34" id="page34"></a>[page&nbsp;34]</span>
<p>The lower still I fall, only supreme</p>
<p>In misery! Such joy ambition finds.</p>
<p>But say I could repent, and could obtain</p>
<p>By act of grace, my former state; how soon</p>
<p>Would height recall high thoughts, how soon unsay</p>
<p>What faint submission swore? Ease would recant</p>
<p>Vows made in pain, as violent and void.</p>
<p>For never can true reconcilement grow,</p>
<p>Where wounds of deadly hate have pierced so deep:</p>
<p>Which would but lead me to a worse relapse</p>
<p>And heavier fall; so should I purchase dear</p>
<p>Short intermission bought with double smart.</p>
<p>This knows my Punisher; therefore as far</p>
<p>From granting he, as I from begging, peace;</p>
<p>All hope excluded thus, behold, instead</p>
<p>Of us outcast, exiled, his new delight,</p>
<p>Mankind created, and for him this world,</p>
<p>So farewell, hope; and with hope, farewell, fear;</p>
<p>Farewell, remorse! all good to me is lost;</p>
<p>Evil, be thou my good; by thee at least</p>
<p>Divided empire with Heaven's King I hold,</p>
<p>By thee, and more than half perhaps will reign;</p>
<p>As man, ere long, and this new world shall know.</p>

<p class="i2">&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>ATRICK O'FLANIGAN</b>, from Erin's isle</p>
<p class="i4">Just fresh, thinking he'd walk around a while,</p>
<p>With open mouth and widely staring eyes,</p>
<p>Cried "Och!" and "Whist!" at every new surprise.</p>
<p>He saw some labourers in a field of corn;</p>
<p>The golden pumpkins lit the scene with glory;</p>
<p>Of all that he had heard since being born,</p>
<p>Nothing had equaled this in song or story.</p>
<p>"The holy mither! and, sirs, would ye plaise</p>
<p>To be a tellin' me what might be these?</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page35" id="page35"></a>[page&nbsp;35]</span>
<p>An' sure I'm thinkin' that they're not pratees,</p>
<p>But mebbe it's the way you grow your chase."</p>
<p>"Ah, Patrick, these are mare's eggs," said the hand,</p>
<p>Giving a wink to John, and Jim, and Bill;</p>
<p>"Just hatch it out, and then you have your horse;</p>
<p>Take one and try it; it will pay you well."</p>
<p>"Faith an' that's aisy sure; in dear ould Ireland</p>
<p>I always had my Christmas pig so nate,</p>
<p>Fatted on buttermilk, and hard to bate;</p>
<p>But only gintlemen can own a horse.</p>
<p>Ameriky's a great counthry indade,</p>
<p>I thought that here I'd kape a pig, of coorse,</p>
<p>Have me own land, and shanty without rent,</p>
<p>An' have me vote, an' taxes not a cint;</p>
<p>But sure I niver thought to own a baste.</p>
<p>An' won't the wife and childer now be glad?</p>
<p>A thousand blissings on your honor's head!</p>
<p>But could ye tell by lookin' at the egg</p>
<p>What colour it will hatch? It's to me taste</p>
<p>To have a dapple gray, with a long tail,</p>
<p>High in the neck, and slinder in the leg,</p>
<p>To jump a twel' feet bog, and niver fail,</p>
<p>Like me Lord Dumferline's at last year's races&mdash;"</p>
<p>Just then the merry look on all their faces</p>
<p>Checked Patrick's flow of talk, and with a blush</p>
<p>That swept his face as milk goes over mush,</p>
<p>He added, "Sure, I know it is no use</p>
<p>To try to tell by peering at an egg</p>
<p>If it will hatch a gander or a goose;"</p>
<p>Then looked around to make judicious choice.</p>
<p>"Pick out the largest one that you can hide</p>
<p>Out of the owner's sight there by the river;</p>
<p>Don't drop and break it, or the colt is gone;</p>
<p>Carry it gently to your little farm,</p>
<p>Put it in bed, and keep it six weeks warm."</p>
<p>Quickly Pat seized a huge, ripe, yellow one,</p>
<p>"Faith, sure, an' I'll do every bit of that</p>
<p>The whole sax wakes I'll lie meself in bed,</p>
<p>An' kape it warrum, as your honour said;</p>
<p>Long life to yees, and may you niver walk,</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page36" id="page36"></a>[page&nbsp;36]</span>
<p>Not even to your grave, but ride foriver;</p>
<p>Good luck to yees," and without more of talk</p>
<p>He pulled the forelock 'neath his tattered hat,</p>
<p>And started off; but plans of mice and men</p>
<p>Gang oft agley, again and yet again.</p>
<p>Full half a mile upon his homeward road</p>
<p>Poor Patrick toiled beneath his <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'heayy'">heavy</ins> load.</p>
<p>A <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'hiltop'">hilltop</ins> gained, he stopped to rest, alas!</p>
<p>He laid his mare's egg on some treacherous grass;</p>
<p>When down the steep hillside it rolled away,</p>
<p>And at poor Patrick's call made no delay.</p>
<p>Gaining momentum, with a heavy thump,</p>
<p>It struck and split upon a hollow stump,</p>
<p>In which a rabbit lived with child and wife,</p>
<p>Frightened, the timid creature ran for life.</p>
<p>"Shtop, shtop my colt!" cried Patrick, as he ran</p>
<p>After his straying colt, but all in vain.</p>
<p>With ears erect poor Bunny faster fled</p>
<p>As "Shtop my colt!" in mournful, eager tones</p>
<p>Struck on those organs, till with fright half dead</p>
<p>He hid away among some grass and stones.</p>
<p>Here Patrick searched till rose the harvest moon,</p>
<p>Braying and whinnying till he was hoarse,</p>
<p>Hoping to lure the colt by this fond cheat;</p>
<p>"For won't the young thing want his mither soon,</p>
<p>And come to take a bit of something t'eat?"</p>
<p>But vain the tender accents of his call&mdash;</p>
<p>No colt responded from the broken wall;</p>
<p>And 'neath the twinkling stars he plodded on,</p>
<p>To tell how he had got and lost his horse.</p>
<p>"As swate a gray as iver eyes sat on,"</p>
<p>He said to Bridget and the children eight,</p>
<p>After thrice telling the whole story o'er,</p>
<p>The way he run it would be hard to bate;</p>
<p>So little, too, with jist a whisk o' tail,</p>
<p>Not a pin-feather on it as I could see,</p>
<p>For it was hatched out just sax weeks too soon!</p>
<p>An' such long ears were niver grown before</p>
<p>On any donkey in grane Ireland!</p>
<p>So little, too, you'd hold it in your hand;</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page37" id="page37"></a>[page&nbsp;37]</span>
<p>Och hone! he would have made a gray donkey."</p>
<p>So all the sad O'Flanigans that night</p>
<p>Held a loud wake over the donkey gone,</p>
<p>Eating their "pratees" without milk or salt,</p>
<p>Howling between whiles, "Och! my little colt!"</p>
<p>While Bunny, trembling from his dreadful fright,</p>
<p>Skipped home to Mrs. B. by light of moon,</p>
<p>And told the story of his scare and flight;</p>
<p>And all the neighbouring rabbits played around</p>
<p>The broken mare's egg scattered on the ground.</p>

<h2>THE WORLD FOR SALE.</h2>

<p class="indright"><b>REV. RALPH HOYT.</b></p>

<p style="line-height: 1%; margin-top: -0.5em;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="dropcap" ><span class="dcap">T</span>
<b>HE</b> world for sale! Hang out the sign; call
every traveler here to me: who'll buy this brave
estate of mine, and set this weary spirit free? 'Tis
going! yes, I mean to fling the bauble from my soul
away; I'll sell it, whatsoe'er it bring: the world's at
auction here to-day! It is a glorious sight to see&mdash;but,
ah! it has deceived me sore; it is not what it
seems to be. For sale! it shall be mine no more.
Come, turn it o'er and view it well; I would not have
you purchase dear. 'Tis going! going! I must
sell! Who bids! who'll buy this splendid Tear?
Here's Wealth, in glittering heaps of gold; who
bids? But let me tell you fair, a baser lot was never
sold! Who'll buy the heavy heaps of Care? and,
here, spread out in broad domain, a goodly landscape
all may trace; hall, cottage, tree, field, hill
and plain:&mdash;who'll buy himself a burial place?
Here's Love, the dreamy potent spell that Beauty
flings around the heart; I know its power, alas! too
well; 'tis going! Love and I must part! Must
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page38" id="page38"></a>[page&nbsp;38]</span>
part? What can I more with Love? all o'er is the
enchanter's reign. Who'll buy the plumeless, dying
dove&mdash;a breath of bliss, a storm of pain? And
Friendship, rarest gem of earth; who e'er has found
the jewel his? Frail, fickle, false, and little worth!
who bids for Friendship&mdash;as it is? 'Tis going!
going! hear the call; once, twice and thrice, 'tis
very low! 'Twas once my hope, my stay, my all,
but now the broken staff must go! Fame! hold the
brilliant meteor high; how dazzling every gilded
name! Ye millions! now's the time to buy. How
much for Fame? how much for Fame? Hear how it
thunders! Would you stand on high Olympus, far
renowned, now purchase, and a world command!&mdash;and
be with a world's curses crowned. Sweet star of
Hope! with ray to shine in every sad foreboding
breast, save this desponding one of mine&mdash;who bids
for man's last friend, and best? Ah, were not mine
a bankrupt life, this treasure should my soul sustain!
But Hope and Care are now at strife, nor ever may
unite again. Ambition, Fashion, Show and Pride, I
part from all forever now; Grief, in an overwhelming
tide, has taught my haughty heart to bow. By
Death, stern sheriff! all bereft, I weep, yet humbly
kiss the rod; the best of all I still have left&mdash;my
Faith, My Bible, and my <span class="sc">God</span>.</p>

<h2>HOW WE HUNTED A MOUSE.</h2>

<p class="indright"><b>JOSHUA JENKINS.</b></p>

<p class="dropcap" ><span class="dcap">I</span>
&nbsp;<b>WAS</b> dozing comfortably in my easy-chair, and
dreaming of the good times which I hope are
coming, when there fell upon my ears a most startling
scream. It was the voice of my Maria Ann in
agony. The voice came from the kitchen and to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page39" id="page39"></a>[page&nbsp;39]</span>
kitchen I rushed. The idolized form of my Maria
was perched on a chair, and she was flourishing an
iron spoon in all directions, and shouting "shoo," in
a general manner, at everything in the room. To my
anxious inquiries as to what was the matter, she
screamed, "O Joshua! a mouse, shoo&mdash;wha&mdash;shoo&mdash;a
great&mdash;ya, shoo&mdash;horrid mouse, and&mdash;she&mdash;ew&mdash;it
ran right out of the cupboard&mdash;shoo&mdash;go away&mdash;O
Lord&mdash;Joshua&mdash;shoo&mdash;kill it, oh, my&mdash;shoo."</p>

<p>All that fuss, you see, about one little harmless
mouse. Some women are so afraid of mice. Maria
is. I got the poker and set myself to poke that
mouse, and my wife jumped down, and ran off into
another room. I found the mouse in a corner under
the sink. The first time I hit it I didn't poke it any
on account of getting the poker all tangled up in a
lot of dishes in the sink; and I did not hit it any
more because the mouse would not stay still. It ran
right toward me, and I naturally jumped, as anybody
would; but I am not afraid of mice, and when the
horrid thing ran up inside the leg of my pantaloons,
I yelled to Maria because I was afraid it would gnaw
a hole in my garment. There is something real
disagreeable about having a mouse inside the leg of
one's pantaloons, especially if there is nothing
between you and the mouse. Its toes are cold, and
its nails are scratchy, and its fur tickles, and its tail
feels crawly, and there is nothing pleasant about it,
and you are all the time afraid it will try to gnaw
out, and begin on you instead of on the cloth. That
mouse was next to me. I could feel its every motion
with startling and suggestive distinctness. For these
reasons I yelled to Maria, and as the case seemed
urgent to me I may have yelled with a certain degree
of vigor; but I deny that I yelled fire, and if I catch
the boy who thought that I did, I shall inflict punishment
on his person.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page40" id="page40"></a>[page&nbsp;40]</span>

<p>I did not loose my presence of mind for an instant.
I caught the mouse just as it was clambering over
my knee, and by pressing firmly on the outside of the
cloth, I kept the animal a prisoner on the inside. I
kept jumping around with all my might to confuse it,
so that it would not think about biting, and I yelled
so that the mice would not hear its squeaks and come
to its assistance. A man can't handle many mice at
once to advantage.</p>

<p>Maria was white as a sheet when she came into
the kitchen and asked what she should do&mdash;as
though I could hold the mouse and plan a campaign
at the same time. I told her to think of something,
and she thought she would throw things at the
intruder; but as there was no earthly chance for her
to hit the mouse, while every shot took effect on me,
I told her to stop, after she had tried two flat-irons
and the coal-scuttle. She paused for breath; but I
kept bobbing around. Somehow I felt no inclination
to sit down anywhere. "O Joshua," she cried, "I
wish you had not killed the cat." Now I submit that
the wish was born of the weakness of woman's
intellect. How on earth did she suppose a cat could
get where that mouse was?&mdash;rather have the mouse
there alone, anyway, than to have a cat prowling
around after it. I reminded Maria of the fact that
she was a fool. Then she got the tea-kettle and
wanted to scald the mouse. I objected to that process,
except as a last resort. Then she got some
cheese to coax the mouse down, but I did not dare to
let go, for fear it would run up. Matters were getting
desperate. I told her to think of something else, and
I kept jumping. Just as I was ready to faint with
exhaustion, I tripped over an iron, lost my hold, and
the mouse fell to the floor, very dead. I had no idea
a mouse could be squeezed to death so easy.</p>

<p>That was not the end of the trouble, for before I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page41" id="page41"></a>[page&nbsp;41]</span>
had recovered my breath a fireman broke in one of
the front windows, and a whole company followed him
through, and they dradged hose around, and mussed
things all over the house, and then the foreman
wanted to thrash me because the house was not on
fire, and I had hardly got him pacified before a
policeman came in and arrested me. Some one had
run down and told him I was drunk and was killing
Maria. It was all Maria and I could do, by combining
our eloquence, to prevent him from marching me
off in disgrace, but we finally got matters quieted and
the house clear.</p>

<p>Now when mice run out of the cupboard I go outdoors,
and let Maria "shoo" them back again. I
can kill a mouse, but the fun don't pay for the
trouble.</p>

<p>I blessed Thee in the radiant day,</p>

<h2>GIVE ME BACK MY HUSBAND.</h2>

<p style="line-height: 1%; margin-top: -0.5em;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="dropcap" ><span class="dcap">N</span>
<b>OT</b> many years since, a young married couple
from the far "fast-anchored isle" sought our
shores with the most sanguine anticipations of
happiness and prosperity. They had begun to
realize more than they had seen in the visions of
hope, when, in an evil hour, the husband was tempted
"to look upon the wine when it is red," and to
taste of it, "when it giveth its colour in the cup."
The charmer fastened round its victim all the
serpent-spells of its sorcery, and he fell; and at
every step of his degradation from the man to the
brute, and downward, a heartstring broke in the
bosom of his companion.</p>

<p>Finally, with the last spark of hope flickering on
the altar of her heart, she threaded her way into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page45" id="page45"></a>[page&nbsp;45]</span>
one of those shambles where man is made such a
thing as the beasts of the field would bellow at.
She pressed her way through the bacchanalian
crowd who were revelling there in their own ruin.
With her bosom full of "that perilous stuff that
preys upon the heart," she stood before the plunderer
of her husband's destiny, and exclaimed in tones
of startling anguish, "<i>Give me back my husband!</i>"</p>

<p>"There's your husband," said the man, as he
pointed toward the prostrate wretch.</p>

<p>"<i>That my husband?</i> What have you done to
him? <i>That my husband?</i> What have you done
to that noble form that once, like the great oak,
held its protecting shade over the fragile vine that
clung to it for support and shelter? <i>That my
husband?</i> With what torpedo chill have you touched
the sinews of that manly arm? What have you
done to that once noble brow, which he wore high
among his fellows, as if it bore the superscription
of the Godhead? <i>That my husband?</i> What have
you done to that eye, with which he was wont to
look erect on heaven, and see in his mirror the
image of his God? What Egyptian drug have
you poured into his veins, and turned the ambling
fountains of the heart into black and burning pitch?
Give me back my husband! Undo your basilisk
spells, and give me back the <i>man</i> that stood with
me by the altar!"</p>

<p>The ears of the rumseller, ever since the first
demijohn of that burning liquid was opened upon
our shores, have been saluted, at every stage of the
traffic, with just such appeals as this. Such wives,
such widows, and mothers, such fatherless children,
as never mourned in Israel at the massacre of
Bethlehem or at the burning of the temple, have
cried in his ears, morning, night, and evening,
"<i>Give me back my husband! Give me back my boy!</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page46" id="page46"></a>[page&nbsp;46]</span>
<i>Give me back my brother! Give me back my
sister! Give me back my wife!</i>"</p>

<p>But has the rumseller been confounded or speechless
at these appeals? No! not he. He could
show his credentials at a moment's notice with
proud defiance. He always carried in his pocket a
written absolution for all he had done and could do
in his work of destruction. <i>He had bought a letter
of indulgence</i>&mdash;I mean a <i>license!</i>&mdash;a precious instrument,
signed and sealed by an authority stronger
and more respectable than the pope's. <i>He</i> confounded?
Why, the whole artillery of civil power
was ready to open in his defence and support.
Thus shielded by the law, he had nothing to fear
from the enemies of his traffic. He had the image
and superscription of C&aelig;sar on his credentials, and
unto C&aelig;sar he appealed; and unto C&aelig;sar, too, his
<i>victims</i> appealed, and <i>appealed in vain</i>.</p>

<p class="i2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>AVE</b> you heard of the wonderful one-hoss shay,</p>
<p class="i6">That was built in such a logical way</p>
<p>It ran a hundred years to a day,</p>
<p>And then of a sudden, it&mdash;ah, but stay,</p>
<p>I'll tell you what happened without delay,</p>
<p>Scaring the parson into fits,</p>
<p>Frightening people out of their wits,&mdash;</p>
<p>Have you ever heard of that, I say?</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>Seventeen hundred and fifty-five.</p>
<p><i>Georgius Secundus</i> was then alive,&mdash;</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page47" id="page47"></a>[page&nbsp;47]</span>
<p>Snuffy old drone from the German hive.</p>
<p>That was the year when Lisbon town</p>
<p>Saw the earth open and gulp her down,</p>
<p>And Braddock's army was done so brown,</p>
<p>And left without a scalp to its crown.</p>
<p>It was on the terrible Earthquake-day</p>
<p>That the Deacon finished the one-hoss shay.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>Now in building of chaises, I tell you what,</p>
<p>There is always <i>somewhere</i> a weakest spot,&mdash;</p>
<p>In hub, tire, felloe, in spring or thill,</p>
<p>In panel, or crossbar, or floor, or sill,</p>
<p>In screw, bolt, thoroughbrace,&mdash;lurking still,</p>
<p>Find it somewhere you must and will,&mdash;</p>
<p>Above or below, or within or without,&mdash;</p>
<p>And that's the reason beyond a doubt,</p>
<p>A chaise <i>breaks down</i>, but doesn't <i>wear out</i>.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>But the Deacon swore, (as Deacons do,</p>
<p>With an "I dew vum," or an "I tell <i>yeou</i>,")</p>
<p>He would build one shay to beat the taown</p>
<p>'n' the keounty 'n' all the kentry raoun';</p>
<p>&mdash;"Fur," said the Deacon, "'t 's mighty plain</p>
<p>Thut the weakes' place mus' stan' the strain;</p>
<p>'n' the way t' fix it, uz I maintain,</p>
<p class="i16">Is only jest</p>
<p>T' make that place uz strong uz the rest."</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>So the Deacon inquired of the village folk</p>
<p>Where he could find the strongest oak,</p>
<p>That couldn't be split nor bent nor broke,&mdash;</p>
<p>That was for spokes and floor and sills;</p>
<p>He sent for lancewood to make the thills;</p>
<p>The crossbars were ash, from the straightest <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'tress'">trees</ins>;</p>
<p>The panels of whitewood, that cut like cheese,</p>
<p>But lasts like iron for things like these;</p>
<p>The hubs of logs from the "Settler's ellum,"&mdash;</p>
<p>Last of its timber,&mdash;they couldn't sell 'em,</p>
<p>Never an axe had seen their chips,</p>
<p>And the wedges flew from between their lips,</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page48" id="page48"></a>[page&nbsp;48]</span>
<p>Their blunt ends frizzled like celery-tips;</p>
<p>Step and prop-iron, bolt and screw,</p>
<p>Spring, tire, axle and linchpin too,</p>
<p>Steel of the finest, bright and blue;</p>
<p>Thoroughbrace bison-skin, thick and wide;</p>
<p>Boot, top, dasher, from tough old hide</p>
<p>Found in the pit when the tanner died.</p>
<p>That was the way he "put her through."&mdash;</p>
<p>"There!" said the Deacon, "naow she'll dew!"</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>Do! I tell you, I rather guess</p>
<p>She was a wonder, and nothing less!</p>
<p>Colts grew horses, beards turned gray,</p>
<p>Deacon and deaconess dropped away,</p>
<p>Children and grandchildren,&mdash;where were they?</p>
<p>But there stood the stout old one-hoss shay</p>
<p>As fresh as on Lisbon-earthquake day!</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p><span class="sc">Eighteen hundred</span>;&mdash;it came and found</p>
<p>The Deacon's masterpiece strong and sound.</p>
<p>Eighteen hundred increased by ten;&mdash;</p>
<p>"Hahnsum kerridge" they called it then.</p>
<p>Eighteen hundred and twenty came;&mdash;</p>
<p>Running as usual; much the same.</p>
<p>Thirty and forty at last arrive,</p>
<p>And then come fifty, and <span class="sc">fifty-five</span>.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>Little of all we value here</p>
<p>Wakes on the morn of its hundredth year</p>
<p>Without both feeling and looking queer.</p>
<p>In fact, there's nothing that keeps its youth,</p>
<p>So far as I know, but a tree and truth.</p>
<p>(This is a moral that runs at large;</p>
<p>Take it.&mdash;You're welcome.&mdash;No extra charge.)</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p><span class="sc">First of November</span>,&mdash;the Earthquake-day,&mdash;</p>
<p>There are traces of age in the one-hoss shay,</p>
<p>A general flavor of mild decay,</p>
<p>But nothing local as one may say.</p>
<p>There couldn't be,&mdash;for the Deacon's art</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page49" id="page49"></a>[page&nbsp;49]</span>
<p>Had made it so like in every part</p>
<p>That there wasn't a chance for one to start.</p>
<p>For the wheels were just as strong as the thills,</p>
<p>And the floor was just as strong as the sills,</p>
<p>And the panels just as strong as the floor,</p>
<p>And the whippletree neither less nor more,</p>
<p>And the back crossbar as strong as the fore,</p>
<p>And spring and axle and hub <i>encore</i>.</p>
<p>And yet, <i>as a whole</i>, it is past a doubt</p>
<p>In another hour it will be <i>worn out!</i></p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>First of November, 'Fifty-five!</p>
<p>This morning the parson takes a drive.</p>
<p>Now, small boys, get out of the way!</p>
<p>Here comes the wonderful one-hoss shay,</p>
<p>Drawn by a rat-tailed, ewe-necked bay.</p>
<p>"Huddup!" said the parson.&mdash;Off went they.</p>
<p>The parson was working his Sunday's text,&mdash;</p>
<p>Had got to fifthly, and stopped perplexed</p>
<p>At what the&mdash;Moses&mdash;was coming next.</p>
<p>All at once the horse stood still,</p>
<p>Close by the meet'n'-house on the hill.</p>
<p>&mdash;First a shiver, and then a thrill,</p>
<p>Then something decidedly like a spill,&mdash;</p>
<p>And the parson was sitting upon a rock,</p>
<p>At half-past nine by the meet'n'-house clock,&mdash;</p>
<p>Just the hour of the Earthquake shock!</p>
<p>&mdash;What do you think the parson found,</p>
<p>When he got up and stared around?</p>
<p>The poor old chaise in a heap or mound,</p>
<p>As if it had been to the mill and ground!</p>
<p>You see, of course, if you're not a dunce,</p>
<p>How it went to pieces all at once,&mdash;</p>
<p>All at once, and nothing first,&mdash;</p>
<p>Just as bubbles do when they burst.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>End of the wonderful one-hoss shay.</p>

<h2>THE INJURED MOTHER.</h2>

  </div>  </div>

<blockquote><p>
[This play has many passages of splendid diction, well calculated for bold
declamation. The plot of the piece runs thus: <i>Barbarossa</i> having killed,
and then usurped the throne of his friend and master, tries to obtain the
hand of Zaphira, the late monarch's widow&mdash;having previously destroyed,
(as is supposed) her son, <i>Selim</i>. The following scene represents the interviews
between the unhappy queen and her faithful Othman, and of the
queen with Barbarossa.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Costumes.</span>&mdash;<i>Barbarossa</i> green velvet robe, scarlet satin shirt, white
trousers, russet boots, and turban. <i>Othman</i>, scarlet fly, yellow satin shirt,
white slippers, turban white, scarlet cashmere vest. <i>Zaphira</i>, white dress,
embroidered with silver, turban, and Turkish shoes.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Note.</span>&mdash;A little taste will enable any smart young lady to make up these
dresses. They are mostly loose, and the embroidery may be of tinsel&mdash;while
cheap velveteen looks as well as the best velvet on the stage.]

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Scene.</span>&mdash;<i>Recitation-Room at a Public School.</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="sc">Fred.</span></p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;A pretty task Master Green has given me
this time! He calls me to his desk, and says,
"Brown, those boys, Gray and White, have been
very inattentive during the music lesson: take them
into the recitation-room, and keep them there until
they can sing four stanzas of 'The Battle-cry of
Freedom.'" A nice music-master I am! I can't
read, sing, or growl a note, and I don't know a single
line of "The Battle-cry of Freedom." But I must
not let them know that. Here they are. &nbsp;&nbsp;(<i>Enter</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page59" id="page59"></a>[page&nbsp;59]</span>
<span class="sc">Gray</span> <i>and</i> <span class="sc">White</span>; <i>they get in a corner of the stage,
and whisper together.</i>) &nbsp;&nbsp;Now, what conspiracy is
hatching? Hem! Here, you fellows, do you know
what you came here for?</p>

<p><i>Gray.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;To take a music lesson, I suppose.</p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Well, you had better commence.</p>

<p><i>White.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Certainly, after you.</p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;After me! What do you mean?</p>

<p><i>White.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;I believe it's the custom of all
music-masters to first sing the song they wish to teach.
&nbsp;&nbsp;(<i>Aside to</i> <span class="sc">Gray</span>.) &nbsp;&nbsp;He can't sing a note.</p>

<p><i>Gray.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;(<i>Aside to</i> <span class="sc">White</span>.) &nbsp;&nbsp;He can't? good!
Let's plague him. &nbsp;&nbsp;(<i>Aloud.</i>) &nbsp;&nbsp;Come, singing-master,
proceed.</p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;No matter about me. You two can sing,
and when you make a mistake I will correct it.</p>

<p><i>Gray.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;You'll correct it! That's good. With what, pray?</p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;With this. (<i>Producing a ratten from
under his jacket.</i>)</p>

<p><i>White.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;O, dear, I don't like that sort of tuning-fork.</p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;You'll get it if you don't hurry. Come,
boys, "The Battle-cry of Freedom."</p>

<p><i>Gray.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;(<i>Aside to</i> <span class="sc">White</span>.) &nbsp;&nbsp;Ned, do you know the
song?</p>

<p><i>White.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;(<i>Aside.</i>) &nbsp;&nbsp;I know just one line.</p>

<p><i>Gray.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;(<i>Aside.</i>) &nbsp;&nbsp;O, dear, we're in a scrape.
(<i>Aloud.</i>) &nbsp;&nbsp;Master Fred, will you please give me the
first line? I've forgotten it.</p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Certainly. Let me see. "Rock me to
sleep, mother." &nbsp;&nbsp;No, that isn't it.</p>

<p><i>White.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;(<i>Aside.</i>) &nbsp;&nbsp;He's split on that rock.</p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Hem! ah! "Dear father, dear father,
come home." O, bother!</p>

<p><i>Gray.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;(<i>Aside.</i>) &nbsp;&nbsp;It'll bother him to "come
home" with that line.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page60" id="page60"></a>[page&nbsp;60]</span>

<p><i>Fred.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;"Give me a cot."&mdash;O, pshaw! I tell you
what, boys, I didn't come here to talk, but to listen:
now you two sing away at once, or down comes the
ratten.</p>

<p><i>Gray.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;(<i>Aside.</i>) I say, Ned, Brown doesn't know
it? here's fun. Now you just keep quiet, and ring in
your line when I snap my fingers.</p>

<p><i>White.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;(<i>Aside.</i>) &nbsp;&nbsp;All right. I understand.
When you snap, I sing.</p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Come, come! Strike up, or I shall strike
down.</p>

<h2>THE VULTURE OF THE ALPS.</h2>

<p class="indright"><b>ANONYMOUS.</b></p>

<blockquote><p>
[The following stirring poem is highly dramatic. The reader should, as
far as possible, realize the feelings of the shepherd-parent as he sees "the
youngest of his babes" borne in the iron-claws of the vulture high in mid
air towards his golgotha of a nest. Much force of attitude and gesture is
not only admissable, but called for, as the agonized father leans forward
following the flight of the vulture.]

expression, both in words and action. Falstaff throws himself
into all the attitudes, and elevates and depresses his voice, as if
he was actually engaged in the combat he describes&mdash;preserving
the utmost gravity of face, until he finds that the Prince has
really detected him. Then the "fat rogue" bursts into a jolly,
unctuous laugh, and carries off the honors, after all:

<p><i>P. Henry.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;What's the matter?</p>

<p><i>Fal.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;What's the matter? there be four of us here
have ta'en a thousand pound this morning.</p>

<p><i>P. Hen.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Where is it, Jack? where is it?</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page65" id="page65"></a>[page&nbsp;65]</span>

<p><i>Fal.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Where is it? taken from us it is: a hundred
upon poor four of us.</p>

<p><i>P. Hen.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;What, a hundred, man?</p>

<p><i>Fal.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;I am a rogue, if I were not at half-sword
with a dozen of them two hours together. I have
'scaped by miracle. I am eight times thrust through
the doublet; four, through the hose; my buckler cut
through and through; my sword hacked like a hand-saw
<i>ecce signum</i>. I never dealt better since I was a
man: all would not do. A plague of all cowards!&mdash;Let
them speak: if they speak more or less than
truth, they are villains, and the sons of darkness.</p>

<p><i>P. Hen.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Speak, sirs: how was it?</p>

<p><i>Gads.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;We four set upon some dozen,&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Fal.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Sixteen at least, my lord.</p>

<p><i>Gads.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;And bound them.</p>

<p><i>Peto.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;No, no, they were not bound.</p>

<p><i>Fal.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;You rogue, they were bound, every man of
them; or I am a Jew else, an Ebrew Jew.</p>

<p><i>Gads.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;As we were sharing, some six or seven
fresh men set upon us.</p>

<p><i>Fal.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;And unbound the rest, and then come in the
other.</p>

<p><i>P. Hen.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;What, fought ye with them all?</p>

<p><i>Fal.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;All! I know not what ye call, all; but if I
fought not with fifty of them, I am a bunch of radish;
if there were not two or three and fifty upon poor old
Jack, then I am no two-legged creature.</p>

<p><i>Poins.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Pray God, you have not murdered some of
them.</p>

<p><i>Fal.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Nay, that's past praying for, for I have
peppered two of them: two, I am sure, I have paid;
two rogues in buckram suits. I tell thee what, Hal,&mdash;if
I tell thee a lie, spit in my face, call me horse.
Thou knowest my old ward;&mdash;here I lay, and thus
I bore my point. Four rogues in buckram let drive at
me.&mdash;</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page66" id="page66"></a>[page&nbsp;66]</span>

<p><i>P. Hen.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;What, four? thou said'st but two, even
now.</p>

<p><i>Fal.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Four, Hal; I told thee four.</p>

<p><i>Poins.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Ay, ay, he said four.</p>

<p><i>Fal.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;These four came all a-front, and mainly
thrust at me. I made no more ado, but took all their
seven points in my target, thus.</p>

<p><i>P. Hen.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Seven? why, there were but four, even
now.</p>

<p><i>Fal.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;In buckram.</p>

<p><i>Poins.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Ay, four in buckram suits.</p>

<p><i>Fal.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Seven, by these hilts, or I am a villain else.</p>

<p><i>P. Hen.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Pr'ythee, let him alone; we shall have
more anon.</p>

<p><i>Fal.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Dost thou hear me, Hal?</p>

<p><i>P. Hen.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Ay, and mark thee too, Jack.</p>

<p><i>Fal.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Do, so, for it is worth the listening to. The
nine in buckram that I told thee of,&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>P. Hen.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;So, two more already.</p>

<p><i>Fal.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Their points being broken,&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Poins.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Down fell their hose.</p>

<p><i>Fal.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Began to give me ground: But I followed
me close, came in foot and hand: and, with a
thought, seven of the eleven I paid.</p>

<p><i>P. Hen.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;O monstrous! eleven buckram men
grown out of two!</p>

<p><i>Fal.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;But, as the devil would have it, three misbegotten
knaves, in Kendal green, came at my back,
and let drive at me; for it was so dark, Hal, that
thou couldst not see thy hand.</p>

<p><i>P. Hen.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;These lies are like the father that begets
them; gross as a mountain, open palpable. Why,
thou clay-brained guts; thou knotty-pated fool! thou
whoreson, obscene, greasy, tallow-keech,&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Fal.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;What, art thou mad? art thou mad? is not
the truth, the truth?</p>

<p><i>P. Hen.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Why, how couldst thou know these men
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page67" id="page67"></a>[page&nbsp;67]</span>
in Kendal green, when it was so dark thou couldst
not see thy hand? come, tell us thy reason; what
sayest thou to this?</p>

<p><i>Poins.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Come, your reason, Jack, your reason.</p>

<p><i>Fal.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;What, upon compulsion? No; were I at
the strappado, or all the racks in the world, I would
not tell you on compulsion. Give you a reason on
compulsion! if reasons were as plenty as blackberries
I would give no man a reason upon compulsion, I.</p>

<p><i>P. Hen.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;I'll be no longer guilty of this sin; this
sanguine coward, this bed-presser, this horse back-breaker,
this huge hill of flesh;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Fal.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Away, you starveling, you elf-skin, you
dried neat's-tongue, bull's-pizzle, you stock-fish,&mdash;O
for breath to utter what is like thee!&mdash;you tailor's
yard, you sheathe, you bow-case, you vile standing
tuck;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>P. Hen.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Well, breathe a while and then to it
again; and when thou hast tired thyself in base
comparisons hear me speak but this.</p>

<p><i>Poins.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Mark, Jack.</p>

<p><i>P. Hen.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;We two saw you four set on four: you
bound them, and were masters of their wealth.&mdash;Mark
now how plain a tale shall put you down.&mdash;Then
did we two set on you four: and, with a word,
out-faced you from your prize, and have it; yea, and
can show it you here in the house:&mdash;and, Falstaff,
you carried your guts away as nimbly, with as quick
dexterity, and roared for mercy, and still ran and
roared, as ever I heard bull-calf. What a slave art
thou, to hack thy sword, as thou hast done; and
then say, it was a fight! What trick, what device,
what starting-hole, canst now find out, to hide thee
from this open and apparent shame?</p>

<p><i>Poins.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Come, let's hear, Jack: What trick hast
thou now?</p>

<p><i>Fal.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;By the Lord, I knew ye, as well as he that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page68" id="page68"></a>[page&nbsp;68]</span>
made ye. Why, hear ye, my masters: Was it for
me to kill the heir apparent? Should I turn upon the
true prince? Why, thou knowest, I am as valiant as
Hercules; but beware instinct; the lion will not
touch the true prince. Instinct is a great matter; I
was a coward on instinct. I shall think the better of
myself and thee, during my life; I, for a valiant
lion, and thou for a true prince. But, by the Lord,
lads, I am glad you have the money.&mdash;Hostess, clap
to the doors; watch to-night, pray to-morrow.&mdash;Gallant,
lads, boys, hearts of gold. All the titles of
good fellowship come to you! What, shall we be
merry? shall we have a play extempore?</p>

<h2>A VENTRILOQUIST ON A STAGE-COACH.</h2>

<p class="indright"><b>HENRY COCKTON.</b></p>

<p style="line-height: 1%; margin-top: -0.5em;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="dropcap" ><span class="dcap">N</span>
<b>OW</b> then, look alive there!" shouted the coachman
from the booking-office door, as Valentine
and his Uncle John approached. "Have yow
got that are mare's shoe made comfor'ble, Simon!"</p>

<p>"All right, sir," said Simon, and he went round to
see if it were so, while the luggage was being
secured.</p>

<p>"Jimp up, genelmen!" cried the coachman, as he
waddled from the office with his whip in one hand
and his huge way-bill in the other; and the passengers
accordingly proceeded to arrange themselves on
the various parts of the coach,&mdash;Valentine, by the
particular desire of Uncle John, having deposited
himself immediately behind the seat of the coachman.</p>

<p>"If you please," said an old lady, who had been
standing in the gateway upwards of an hour, "will
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page77" id="page77"></a>[page&nbsp;77]</span>
you be good enow, please, to take care of my
darter?"</p>

<p>"All safe," said the coachman, untwisting the
reins. "She shaunt take no harm. Is she going all
the way?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," replied the old lady; "God bless her!
She's got a place in Lunnun, an' I'm told&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hook on them ere two sacks o' whoats there behind,"
cried the coachman; "I marn't go without
'em this time.&mdash;Now, all right there?"</p>

<p>"Good by, my dear," sobbed the old lady, "do
write to me soon, be sure you do,&mdash;I only want to
hear from you often. Take care of yourself."</p>

<p>"Hold hard!" cried the coachman, as the horses
were dancing, on the cloths being drawn from their
loins. "Whit, whit!" and away they pranced, as
merrily as if they had known that <i>their</i> load was
nothing when compared with the load they left behind
them. Even old Uncle John, as he cried
"Good by, my dear boy," and waved his hand for
the last time, felt the tears trickling down his
cheeks.</p>

<p>The salute was returned, and the coach passed on.</p>

<p>The fulness of Valentine's heart caused him for the
first hour to be silent; but after that, the constant
change of scene and the pure bracing air had the
effect of restoring his spirits, and he felt a powerful
inclination to sing. Just, however, as he was about
to commence for his own amusement, the coach
stopped to change horses. In less than two minutes
they started again, and Valentine, who then felt
ready for anything, began to think seriously of the
exercise of his power as a ventriloquist.</p>

<p>"Whit, whit!" said Tooler, the coachman, between
a whisper and a whistle, as the fresh horses
galloped up the hill.</p>

<p>"Stop! hoa!" cried Valentine, assuming a voice,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page78" id="page78"></a>[page&nbsp;78]</span>
the sound of which appeared to have travelled some
distance.</p>

<p>"You have left some one behind," observed a
gentleman in black, who had secured the box seat.</p>

<p>"Oh, let un run a bit!" said Tooler. "Whit! I'll
give un a winder up this little hill, and teach un to
be up in time in future. If we was to wait for every
passenger as chooses to lag behind, we shouldn't git
over the ground in a fortnit."</p>

<p>"Hoa! stop! stop! stop!" reiterated Valentine,
in the voice of a man pretty well out of breath.</p>

<p>Tooler, without deigning to look behind, retickled
the haunches of his leaders, and gleefully chuckled
at the idea of <i>how</i> he was making a passenger sweat.</p>

<p>The voice was heard no more, and Tooler, on
reaching the top of the hill, pulled up and looked
round, but could see no man running.</p>

<p>"Where is he?" inquired Tooler.</p>

<p>"In the ditch!" replied Valentine, throwing his
voice behind.</p>

<p>"In the ditch!" exclaimed Tooler. "Blarm me,
whereabouts?"</p>

<p>"There," said Valentine.</p>

<p>"Bless my soul!" cried the gentleman in black,
who was an exceedingly nervous village clergyman.
"The poor person no doubt is fallen down in an
absolute state of exhaustion. How very, very wrong
of you, coachman, not to stop!"</p>

<p>Tooler, apprehensive of some serious occurrence,
got down with the view of dragging the exhausted
passenger out of the ditch; but although he ran
several hundred yards down the hill, no such person
of course could be found.</p>

<p>"Who saw un?" shouted Tooler, as he panted up
the hill again.</p>

<p>"I saw nothing," said a passenger behind, "but a
boy jumping over the hedge."</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page79" id="page79"></a>[page&nbsp;79]</span>

<p>Tooler looked at his way-bill, counted the
passengers, found them all right, and, remounting
the box, got the horses again into a gallop, in the
perfect conviction that some villanous young scarecrow
had raised the false alarm.</p>

<p>"Whit! blarm them 'ere boys!" said Tooler,
"'stead o' mindin' their crows, they are allus up to
suffen. I only wish I had un here, I'd pay <i>on</i> to
their blarmed bodies; if I would n't&mdash;" At this
interesting moment, and as if to give a practical
illustration of what he would have done in the case,
he gave the off-wheeler so telling a cut round the
loins that the animal without any ceremony kicked
over the trace. Of course Tooler was compelled to
pull up again immediately; and after having adjusted
the trace, and asking the animal seriously what
he meant, at the same time enforcing the question by
giving him a blow on the bony part of the nose, he
prepared to remount; but just as he had got his left
foot upon the nave of the wheel, Valentine so
admirably imitated the sharp snapping growl of a
dog in the front boot, that Tooler started back as
quickly as if he had been shot, while the gentleman
in black dropped the reins and almost jumped into
the road.</p>

<p>"Good gracious!" exclaimed the gentleman in
black, trembling with great energy; "How wrong,
how very horribly wrong, of you, coachman, not to
tell me that a dog had been placed beneath my feet."</p>

<p>"Blarm their carcases!" cried Tooler, "they never
told <i>me</i> a dog was shoved there. Lay <i>down</i>!
We'll soon have yow out there together!"</p>

<p>"Not for the world!" cried the gentleman in
black, as Tooler approached the foot-board in order
to open it. "Not for the world! un-un-un-less you
le-le-let me get down first. I have no desire to pe-pe-perish
of hydropho-phobia."</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page80" id="page80"></a>[page&nbsp;80]</span>

<p>"Kip yar fut on the board then, sir, please," said
Tooler, "we'll soon have the varmint out o' that."
So saying, he gathered up the reins, remounted the
box, and started off the horses again at full gallop.</p>

<p>The gentleman in black then began to explain to
Tooler how utterly inconceivable was the number of
persons who had died of hydrophobia within an
almost unspeakable short space of time, in the
immediate vicinity of the residence of a friend of his
in London; and just as he had got into the marrow
of a most excruciating description of the intense
mental and physical agony of which the disease in
its worst stage was productive, both he and Tooler
suddenly sprang back, with their feet in the air, and
their heads between the knees of the passengers behind
them, on Valentine giving a loud growling
snap, more bitingly indicative of anger than before.</p>

<p>As Tooler had tightly hold of the reins when he
made this involuntary spring, the horses stopped on
the instant, and allowed him time to scramble up
again without rendering the slow process dangerous.</p>

<p>"I cannot, I-I-I positively cannot," said the
gentleman in black, who had been thrown again into
a dreadful state of excitement, "I cannot sit here,&mdash;my
nerves cannot endure it; it's perfectly shocking."</p>

<p>"Blister their bowls!" exclaimed Tooler, whose
first impulse was to drag the dog out of the boot at
all hazards, but who, on seeing the horses waiting
in the road a short distance ahead for the next stage,
thought it better to wait till he had reached them.
"I'll make un remember this the longest day o' thar
blessed lives,&mdash;blarm un! Phih! I'll let un know
when I get back, I warrant. I'll larn un to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hoa, coachman! hoa! my hat's off!" cried
Valentine, throwing his voice to the back of the
coach.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page81" id="page81"></a>[page&nbsp;81]</span>

<p>"Well, <i>may</i> I be&mdash;phit!" said Tooler. "I'll make
yow run for't anyhow&mdash;phit!"</p>

<p>In less than a minute the coach drew up opposite
the stable, when the gentleman in black at once
proceeded to alight. Just, however, as his foot
reached the plate of the roller-bolt, another growl
from Valentine frightened him backwards, when falling
upon one of the old horse-keepers, he knocked
him fairly down, and rolled over him heavily.</p>

<p>"Darng your cloomsy carkus," cried the horse-keeper,
gathering himself up, "carn't you git oof ar
cooarch aroat knocking o' pipple darn?"</p>

<p>"I-I-I beg pardon," tremblingly observed the
gentleman in black; "I hope I-I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Whoap! pardon!" contemptuously echoed the
horse-keeper as he limped towards the bars to
unhook the leaders' traces.</p>

<p>"Now then, yow warmint, let's see who yow belong
to," said Tooler, approaching the mouth of the
boot; but just as he was in the act of raising the
foot-board, another angry snap made him close it
again with the utmost rapidity.</p>

<p>"Lay down! blarm your body!" cried Tooler,
shrinking back. "Here, yow Jim, kim here, bor,
and take this 'ere devil of a dog out o' that."</p>

<p>Jim approached, and the growling was louder than
before, while the gentleman in black implored Jim to
take care that the animal didn't get hold of his
hand.</p>

<p>"Here, yow Harry!" shouted Jim, "yare noot
afeared o' doogs together,&mdash;darng un, <i>I</i> doont
like un."</p>

<p>Accordingly Harry came, and then Sam, and then
Bob, and then Bill; but as the dog could not be
seen, and as the snarling continued, neither of them
dared to put his hand in to drag the monster forth.
Bob therefore ran off for Tom Titus the blacksmith,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page82" id="page82"></a>[page&nbsp;82]</span>
who was supposed to care for nothing, and in less
than two minutes Tom Titus arrived with about three
feet of rod-iron red hot.</p>

<p>"Darng un!" cried Tom, "this ere 'll maake un
<i>quit</i> together!"</p>

<p>"Dear me! my good man," said the gentleman in
black, "don't use that unchristian implement! don't
put the dumb thing to such horrible torture!"</p>

<p>"It don't siggerfy a button," cried Tooler, "I
marn't go to stop here all day. Out he must come."</p>

<p>Upon this Tom Titus introduced his professional
weapon, and commenced poking about with considerable
energy, while the snapping and growling
increased with each poke.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what it is," said Tom Titus, turning
round and wiping the sweat off his brow with his
naked arm, "this here cretur here's stark raavin'
mad."</p>

<p>"I knew that he was," cried the gentleman in
black, getting into an empty wagon which stood
without horses just out of the road; "I felt perfectly
sure that he was rabid."</p>

<p>"He 's a bull-terrier too," said Tom Titus, "I
knows it by 's growl. It 's the worsest and dargdest
to go maad as is."</p>

<p>"Well, what shall us do wi' th' warment?" said
Tooler.</p>

<p>"Shoot him! shoot him!" cried the gentleman in
black.</p>

<p>"O, I 've goot a blunderbus, Bob!" said Tom
Titus, "yow run for 't together, it 's top o' the forge."</p>

<p>Bob started at once, and Tom kept on the bar,
while Tooler, Sam, and Harry, and Bob held the
heads of the horses.</p>

<p>"He 's got un; all right!" cried Tom Titus, as
Bob neared the coach with the weapon on his
shoulder. "Yow 'll be doon in noo time," he added
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page83" id="page83"></a>[page&nbsp;83]</span>
as he felt with his rod to ascertain in which corner of
the boot the bull-terrier lay.</p>

<p>"Is she loarded?" asked Bob, as he handed Tom
Titus the instrument of death.</p>

<p>"Mind you make the shot come out at bottom,"
shouted Tooler.</p>

<p>"I hool," said Tom Titus, putting the weapon to
his shoulder. "Noo the Loord ha' marcy on yar, as
joodge says sizes," and instantly let fly.</p>

<p>The horses of course plunged considerably, but
still did no mischief; and before the smoke had
evaporated, Valentine introduced into the boot a
low melancholy howl, which convinced Tom Titus
that the shot had taken effect.</p>

<p>"He 's giv oop the ghost; darng his carkus!"
cried Tom, as he poked the dead body in the corner.</p>

<p>"Well, let 's have a look at un," said Tooler, "let 's
see what the warment is like."</p>

<p>The gentleman in black at once leaped out of the
wagon, and every one present drew near, when Tom,
guided by the rod which he had kept upon the body,
put his hand into the boot, and drew forth a fine hare
that had been shattered by the shot all to pieces.</p>

<p>"He arn't a bull-terrier," cried Bob.</p>

<p>"But that arn't he," said Tom Titus. "He 's
some'er aboot here as dead as a darng'd nail. I
know he 's a corpse."</p>

<p>"Are you sure on 't?" asked Tooler.</p>

<p>"There arn't any barn door deader," cried Tom.
"Here, I'll lug um out an' show yar."</p>

<p>"No, no!" shouted Tooler, as Tom proceeded to
pull out the luggage. "I marn't stay for that. I 'm
an hour behind now, blarm un! jimp up, genelmen!"</p>

<p>Tom Titus and his companions, who wanted the
bull-terrier as a trophy, entreated Tooler to allow
them to have it, and, having at length gained his
consent, Tom proceeded to empty the boot. Every eye
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page84" id="page84"></a>[page&nbsp;84]</span>
was, of course, directed to everything drawn out, and
when Tom made a solemn declaration that the boot
was empty, they were all, at once, struck with amazement.
Each looked at the other with astounding
incredulity, and overhauled the luggage again and
again.</p>

<p>"Do you mean to say," said Tooler, "that there
arn't nuffin else in the boot?"</p>

<p>"Darnged a thing!" cried Tom Titus, "coom and
look." And Tooler did look, and the gentleman in
black looked, and Bob looked, and Harry looked,
and Bill looked, and Sam looked, and all looked, but
found the boot empty.</p>

<p>"Well, blarm me!" cried Tooler. "But darng it
all, he must be somewhere!"</p>

<p>"I' ll taake my solum davy," said Bill, "that he
<i>was</i> there."</p>

<p>"I seed um myself," exclaimed Bob, "wi' my oarn
eyes, an' didn't loike the looks on um a bit."</p>

<p>"There cannot," said the gentleman in black, "be
the smallest possible doubt about his having been
there; but the question for our mature consideration
is, where is he now?"</p>

<p>"I 'll bet a pint," said Harry, "you blowed um
away?"</p>

<p>"Blowed um away, you fool!&mdash;how could I ha'
blowed um away?"</p>

<p>"Why, he <i>was</i> there," said Bob, "and he baint
there noo, and he baint here nayther, so you mus ha'
blowed um out o' th' boot; 'sides, look at the muzzle
o' this ere blunderbust!"</p>

<p>"Well, of all the rummest goes as ever happened,"
said Tooler, thrusting his hands to the very bottom
of his pockets, "this ere flogs 'em all into nuffin!"</p>

<p>"It is perfectly astounding!" exclaimed the gentleman
in black, looking again into the boot, while
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page85" id="page85"></a>[page&nbsp;85]</span>
the men stood and stared at each other with their
mouths as wide open as human mouths could be.</p>

<p>"Well, in wi' 'em agin," cried Tooler, "in wi'
'em!&mdash;Blarm me if this here arn't a queer un to get
over."</p>

<p>The luggage was accordingly replaced, and Tooler,
on mounting the box, told the men to get a gallon of
beer, when the gentleman in black generously gave
them half a crown, and the horses started off, leaving
Tom with his blunderbuss, Harry, Bill, Sam, and
their companions, bewildered with the mystery which
the whole day spent in the alehouse by no means
enabled them to solve.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="sc">Mrs. Clipper</span> <i>and</i> <span class="sc">Kitty, r.</span></p>

<p><i>Mrs. C.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;But really, Kitty, I cannot afford it.</p>

<p><i>Kitty.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;O, yes, you can, mother; just this once.
It's such a love of a bonnet! it's so becoming! and
it only costs fifteen dollars.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. C.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Fifteen dollars! Why, child, you are
crazy! We cannot afford to be so extravagant.
The income derived from the property your dear
father left will only allow us to dress in the most
economical manner.</p>

<p><i>Kitty.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;But this bonnet is not extravagant. Dora
Fastone wears a bonnet which cost twenty-five-dollars,
and her father has failed five or six times. I
don't see why I can't have a new bonnet as well as
that proud, stuck-up&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mrs. C.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Hush, my child! never speak ill of our
neighbors because they dress better than we do. If
they spend money foolishly, we should endeavor to use
ours to better purpose. I am sure I should be glad
to gratify you, but we have so many expenses. Your
music lessons cost a great deal of money; and your
brother Harry, off at school, is really suffering for a
new suit of clothes. I must send him some money
to-day.</p>

<p><i>Kitty.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;O, he can wait; he's only a boy; and no
one cares how he looks; but young ladies must dress,
or they are thought nothing of. O, you must let me
have the bonnet, mamma!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. C.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;If you have this bonnet, Kitty, Harry
must go without his new suit.</p>

<p><i>Kitty.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;If you could just see it! It's such a love
of a bonnet! Do let me run down and ask Miss
Thompson to send it up for you to look at.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. C.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;I've no objection to that; and if you
think you need it more than Harry does his new
suit, why&mdash;</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page89" id="page89"></a>[page&nbsp;89]</span>

<p><i>Kitty.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;You'll let me have it. That's a good,
dear mother. I know you wouldn't refuse. I'll run
to Miss Thompson's. I won't be gone long. I
suppose I am selfish; but then, mother, it's such a
love of a bonnet. <span style="float: right; margin-top: -1em;">[<i>Exit</i>, <span class="sc">L.</span></span></p>

<p><i>Mrs. C.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;(<i>Sits in a rocking-chair.</i>) &nbsp;&nbsp;Dear child, it
is hard to refuse her! But one should be made of
money to keep up with the extravagant fashions of
the day.</p>

<p><i>Aunt H.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Angelina, what on airth have them air
Joneses got for dinner? I've sot and sot at that air
front winder till I've got a crick in my back a tryin'
to find out whether it's lamb or mutton. It's something
roasted, anyhow.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. C.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Aunt Hopkins, you are very inquisitive!</p>

<p><i>Aunt H.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Inquisitive! Law sakes, do hear the
child talk! Neow, what harm kin there be in tryin'
to find eout what your neighbors have got for dinner?
I mean to put on my bunnet and run acrost and see.
I know they've got apple dumplin's, for I see the
hired gal throw the parin's out into the yard.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. C.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Run across! Don't dream of such a
thing!</p>

<p><i>Aunt H.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I'm goin' up stairs to git my
specs and have another good look, anyhow; for I'm
jest dyin' to know whether it's lamb or mutton.
Land sakes! what's the use of livin', ef you can't
know how other folks live? <span style="float: right; margin-top: -1em;">[<i>Exit</i>, <span class="sc">R.</span></span></p>

<p><i>Katy.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Will Cornalius coome wid it?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. C.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;I think not. The expressman will bring
it.</p>

<p><i>Katy.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Sure, I don't want the ixpressman. It's
Cornalius I want.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. C.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;This cousin of yours seems very affectionate.

<p><i>Aunt H.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;It's mutton! I was determined to find
eout, and I have! I saw that air Jones boy a playin'
in the street, and I asked him what his folks had got
for dinner, and he said mutton, and neow I'm
satisfied on that air p'int. I wonder what's in this
'ere bandbox! I saw that express cart stop here,
and the man said it was for Miss Kitty somebody;
of course, Angelina's darter. I do wonder what it
is! (<i>Opens box.</i>) Well I declare! A spic span new
bunnet! (<i>Takes out a very large, gaudily-trimmed
bonnet.</i>) And sich a bunnet! Ribbons and lace,
flowers and feathers! Now that's jest what I call a
tasty bunnet! I mean to try it on. It'll jest suit my
complexion. Law sakes! here comes Kitty!

<p><i>Kitty.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Dear me! Here are Mrs. Fastone and
Dora coming up the steps! What shall I do?</p>

<p><i>Aunt H.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Why, let 'em in, of course!</p>

<p><i>Aunt H.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed it has! And sich a beauty!</p>

<p><i>Kitty.</i> O, I'm so glad! But where is it?</p>

<p><i>Aunt H.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Down there behind the table. I hain't

<p><i>Kitty.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;I'll let Miss Dora see that some people
can dress as well as some other people. Aunt
Hopkins, you must manage to draw attention to my
new bonnet while the visitors are here, to give me an
opportunity to show it.</p>

hing.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page93" id="page93"></a>[page&nbsp;93]</span>

<p><i>Kitty.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;No, no! that would be too abrupt.
Manage to speak of bonnets; but do not show it
until they ask to see it.</p>

genteelly.</p>

<p><i>Kitty.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;(<i>Shaking hands with her, and afterwards

you are quite well, and Dora.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. F.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Quite well&mdash;aren't you, Dora?</p>

<p><i>Dora.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Quite, mamma.</p>

<p><i>Kitty.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Pray be seated, ladies. &nbsp;&nbsp;(<i>They sit on

<p><i>Aunt H.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;(<i>Steps over and shakes hands.</i>) &nbsp;&nbsp;Hope
you are pretty well, ma'am, and you, too, miss,

husband? He's a broker&mdash;ain't he? &nbsp;&nbsp;(<i>Sits in

<p><i>Mrs. F.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, Mrs. Hopkins, Mr. Fastone is
a broker, engaged day after day in the busy vortex
of fluctuating enterprises.</p>

<p><i>Aunt H.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I never hearn tell of that business
afore; but I s'pose it's profitable, or you couldn't
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page94" id="page94"></a>[page&nbsp;94]</span>
afford to dress so. Is that a silk or a poplin you've
got on?</p>

has stepped out to make a call.</p>

<p><i>Aunt H.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;No, she hain't; she's only gone to
the butcher's.</p>

<p><i>Kitty.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Aunt Hopkins!&mdash;Mrs. Fastone, what is the
news?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. F.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Well, really nothing. I am dying of
<i>ennui</i>, the world is so quiet; no excitement to move
the placid waters of fashionable society&mdash;is there,
Dora?</p>

<p><i>Dora.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing, mamma.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. F.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing to see, nothing to hear, nothing
to wear,&mdash;is there, Dora?</p>

<p><i>Dora.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing, mamma.</p>

<p><i>Aunt H.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing to wear! Yes, there's
bunnets.</p>

<p><i>Kitty.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Aunt Hopkins!&mdash;Mrs. Fastone, you are
quite correct.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. F.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs. Hopkins spoke of bonnets. I
have been so disappointed! Thompson had a
perfect love of a bonnet that I had quite set my
heart upon for Dora; but it is gone, and the poor
child is almost broken-hearted&mdash;ain't you, Dora?</p>

<p><i>Dora.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Quite, mamma.</p>

<p><i>Kitty.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;I am very sorry, for bonnets are so hard
to find. I have been very much perplexed about
them myself. They are so very commonplace; no
air of refinement about them.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. F.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;None, whatever&mdash;is there, Dora?</p>

<p><i>Dora.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;None, mamma.</p>

<p><i>Kitty.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;I've just had a new one sent home, but it
doesn't suit me.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page95" id="page95"></a>[page&nbsp;95]</span>

<p><i>Aunt H.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Why, Kitty, how you talk! It's a
regular beauty!</p>

<p><i>Kitty.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Aunt Hopkins!&mdash;It is not what I wanted,
but Thompson said it was the most stylish she had.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. F.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Thompson! Did you get it of Thompson?</p>

<p><i>Kitty.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, all my bonnets come from Thompson.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. F.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Do let me see it!</p>

<p><i>Aunt H.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;(<i>Jumps up.</i>) &nbsp;&nbsp;I'll show it to you right
off. It's an eligunt bunnet. (<i>Gets bandbox.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Kitty.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Aunt Hopkins!</p>

<p><i>Aunt H.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Neow don't aunt Hopkins me! for I'm
going to show 'em jest how it looks on yer; set still;
for if there's anything I pride myself on, it's showin'
off a bunnet. &nbsp;&nbsp;(<i>Stands behind</i> <span class="sc">Kitty</span>, <i>puts the bonnet
on her head, and ties it.</i>) &nbsp;&nbsp;There! ain't that a
beauty?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. F.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Why! what a hor&mdash;a handsome bonnet!
Did you ever see anything like it, Dora?</p>

<p><i>Dora.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Never, mamma!</p>

<p><i>Aunt H.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;That's the style, marm.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. F.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Really! I want to know! And this
is Thompson's most stylish bonnet! Really,
how the fashions do change! Did you ever, Dora!</p>

<p><i>Dora.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Never, mamma!</p>

<p><i>Kitty.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;(<i>Aside.</i>) &nbsp;&nbsp;I do believe they are laughing!
Aunt Hopkins, I cannot get it off! You've tied
it in a hard knot!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. F.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;It's very becoming&mdash;isn't it, Dora?</p>

<p><i>Dora.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;O, very, mamma.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. F.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;(<i>Aside to</i> <span class="sc">Dora</span>.)&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;What a horrid
fright!</p>

<p><i>Dora.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Frightful, mamma!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. F.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;I believe we must be moving, for I must
hurry to Thompson's and order just such a bonnet
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page96" id="page96"></a>[page&nbsp;96]</span>
for Dora. Good day. You have such a charming
taste&mdash;hasn't she, Dora?</p>

<p><i>Kitty.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Good day. Call again.&mdash;The hateful
things! They are laughing at me. What ails this
bonnet. (<i>Goes to glass.</i>) Goodness gracious; what
a fright! This is not my bonnet. Aunt Hopkins,
you've ruined me! I shall be the laughing-stock
of the whole neighbourhood. (<i>Tears off the bonnet.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Mrs. C.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Have the Fastones gone?</p>

<p><i>Kitty.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;I hope so. O, mother, send aunt
Hopkins home; she's made me look ridiculous!</p>

<p><i>Aunt H.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I declare! this comes of trying
to please folks!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. C.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Is <i>that</i> your love of a bonnet, Kitty?</p>

<p><i>Kitty.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;No, indeed! Aunt Hopkins, where did
you get this hateful thing?</p>

<p><i>Aunt H.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Out of that bandbox.</p>

<p><i>Kitty.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;(<i>Takes up the cover.</i>) &nbsp;&nbsp;It's marked "Miss
Katy Doolan." You've made a pretty mess of it!</p>

<p><i>Aunt H.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Sakes alive! It's the hired gal's!
Well, I never!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. C.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;But where's the bonnet you sent from
Thompson's?</p>

<p><i>Katy.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;(<i>Outside.</i>) &nbsp;&nbsp;O, murder! that iver I should
say this day!</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="sc">Katy, r.</span>, &nbsp;&nbsp;(<i>holding in her hand an elegant
bonnet.</i>)</p>

<p>The mane, stingy blackgurd has sint me this
whisp of a bunnet, that I'll niver git on my head at
all at all!</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page97" id="page97"></a>[page&nbsp;97]</span>

<p><i>Kitty.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;That's my bonnet!</p>

<p><i>Katy.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Is it, indade? and perhaps ye's be afther
claiming the letther Cornalius Ryan sint wid it.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. C.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;No, no, Katy; there's a little mistake
here. This is your bonnet.</p>

<p><i>Katy.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Faith, now, isn't that a darling, jist! I'll
wear it to church to-morrow, sure.</p>

<p><i>Kitty.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Put it on now, Katy; and then take this
wisp of a bonnet, as you call it, to Miss Thompson,
with my best compliments and tell her I have
decided not to keep it.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. C.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Why, Kitty, I thought your heart was
set upon having it.</p>

<p><i>Kitty.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;So it was, mother; but I shall never dare
to wear it, after the ridiculous appearance I have
just made. It's too fine for me. My conscience
gave me a little twinge as I was coming home.
Send Harry the money for his new suit. My
old bonnet is quite good enough for me.</p>

<p><i>Aunt H.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Neow that's what I call a self-denyin'
gal. I'll fix it up for you; for if there's anything
I pride myself on doin', it's fixing up old bunnets.</p>

<p><i>Kitty.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;And trying on new ones! No, I thank
you, aunt Hopkins. Hereafter I'll look after my
bonnets myself. I think our acquaintance with
Mrs. Fastone will be broken off by this adventure;
and so I will make a merit of necessity, abandon
fashionable society, and be more humble in my
demeanor and in my dress.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. C.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Ah, my child, you will be better satisfied
with your decision, as you grow older, and see
how frivolous are the demands of fashion, and how
little happiness can be obtained by lavish display.
And I think this little adventure, though a severe
lesson, will be far more profitable than the
possession of that "love of a bonnet."</p>

<h2>AN ERUPTION OF MOUNT VESUVIUS.</h2>

<p class="indright"><b>BULWER.</b></p>

<blockquote><p>
The following magnificent description of perhaps the most
awful phenomenon in nature, gives full scope for almost every
tone and gesture. Care should, however, be taken that the
natural grandeur of the subject be not marred by a stilted,
pompous, or affected delivery. Let the speaker try to realize the
thought and feelings of a spectator of the dark scene of desolation,
and he cannot go amiss:
</p></blockquote>

<p style="line-height: 1%; margin-top: -0.5em;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="dropcap" ><span class="dcap">T</span>
<b>HE</b> eyes of the crowd beheld, with ineffable dismay,
a vast vapour shooting from the summit of
Vesuvius, in the form of a gigantic pine-tree; the
trunk, blackness; the branches, fire, that shifted
and wavered in its hues with every moment: now
fiercely luminous, now of a dull and dying red, that
again blazed terrifically forth with intolerable glare.</p>

<p>Then there arose on high the universal shrieks of
women; the men stared at each other, but were
dumb. At that moment they felt the earth shake
beneath their feet; the walls of the theatre trembled;
and beyond, in the distance, they heard the crash of
falling roofs. An instant more, and the mountain-cloud
seemed to roll toward them, dark and rapid
like a torrent; at the same time it cast forth from its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page101" id="page101"></a>[page&nbsp;101]</span>
bosom a shower of ashes, mixed with fragments of
burning stone! Over the crushing vines, over the
desolate streets, over the amphitheatre itself,&mdash;far
and wide,&mdash;with many a mighty splash in the agitated
sea, fell that awful shower!</p>

<p>The cloud advanced, darker, disgorging showers
of ashes and pumice stones; and, amid the other
horrors, the mighty mountain now cast up columns of
boiling water. Blent and kneaded with the half-burning
ashes, the streams fell like seething mud
over the streets, in frequent intervals.</p>

<p>The cloud, which had scattered so deep a murkiness
over the day, at length settled into a solid and
impenetrable mass. But in proportion as the blackness
gathered did the lightnings around Vesuvius
increase in their vivid and scorching glare.</p>

<p>Nor was their horrible beauty confined to their hues
of fire. Now brightly blue, as the most azure depth
of a southern sky; now of a livid and snake-like
green, darting restlessly <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'too'">to</ins>
and fro, as the folds of
an enormous serpent; now of a lurid and intolerable
crimson, gushing forth through the columns of smoke
far and wide, and lighting up all Pompeii; then suddenly
dying into a sickly paleness, like the ghost of
its own life!</p>

<p>In the pauses of the showers were heard the
rumbling of the earth beneath, and the groaning
waves of the tortured sea; or, lower still, and audible
but to the watch of intensest fear, the grinding and
hissing murmur of the escaping gases through the
chasms of the distant mountain.</p>

<p>The ashes, in many places, were already knee-deep;
and in some places immense fragments of
rock, hurled upon the house-roofs, bore down along
the streets masses of confused ruin, which yet more
and more, with every hour, obstructed the way; and,
as the day advanced, the motion of the earth was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page102" id="page102"></a>[page&nbsp;102]</span>
more sensibly felt; the footing seemed to slide and
creep, nor could chariot or litter be kept steady, even
on the most level ground.</p>

<p>Sometimes the huger stones, striking against each
other as they fell, broke into countless fragments,
emitting sparks of fire, which caught whatever was
combustible within their reach; and along the plains
beyond the city the darkness was now terribly relieved,
for several houses and even vineyards had been
set on flames; and at various intervals the fire rose
fiercely and sullenly against the solid gloom. The
citizens had endeavoured to place rows of torches in
the most frequented spots; but these rarely continued
long; the showers and the wind extinguished them.</p>

<p>Suddenly arose an intense and lurid glow. Bright
and gigantic through the darkness which closed
around it, the mountain shone, a pile of fire! Its
summit seemed riven in two; or rather, above its surface,
there seemed to rise two monster-shapes, each
confronting each, as demons contending for a world.
These were of one deep blood-red hue of fire, which
lighted up the whole atmosphere; but below, the
nether part of the mountain was still dark and
shrouded, save in three places, adown which flowed
serpentine, and irregular rivers of molten lava.
Darkly red through the profound gloom of their
banks, they flowed slowly on, as towards the devoted
city. And through the still air was heard the rattling
of the fragments of rock, hurling one upon another,
as they were borne down the fiery cataracts, darkening
for one instant the spot where they fell, and
suffused the next in the burnished hues of the flood
along which they floated!</p>

<p>Suddenly a duller shade fell over the air; and one
of the two gigantic crests into which the summit had
been divided, rocked and waved to and fro; and
then, with a sound, the mightiness of which no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page103" id="page103"></a>[page&nbsp;103]</span>
language can describe, it fell from its burning base,
and rushed, an avalanche of fire, down the sides of
the mountain. At the same instant gushed forth a
volume of blackest smoke, rolling on, over air, sea
and earth. Another, and another, and another
shower of ashes, far more profuse than before, scattered
fresh desolation along the streets, and darkness
once more wrapped them as a veil.</p>

<p>The whole elements of civilization were broken up.
If in the darkness, wife was separated from husband,
or parent from child, vain was the hope of reunion.
Each hurried blindly and confusedly on. Nothing
was left save the law of self-preservation.</p>

<blockquote><p>
In this dialogue, the first speech of Goliath is simple vaunt. Confident
in his <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'hugh'">huge</ins> bulk and strength, he strides occasionally from side to side while
speaking, elevating his arms and throwing his limbs about as if anxious
to display his powerful sinews and muscular proportions. He speaks very
loud, as if willing to terrify all Israel with his voice.</p>

<p>In this second speech, Goliath partly stoops, half shuts his eyes like a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page112" id="page112"></a>[page&nbsp;112]</span>
person endeavouring to discern some diminutive object, and, after looking
intently a short time, suddenly straightens himself up to his full height,
and says arrogantly: "I see him not."</p>

<p>In his third speech, Goliath maintains the same ground, till, in the
conclusion, he seems, at last, to have perceived David, and, turning away
contemptuously, adds: "I do not war with boys."</p>

<p>In the latter part of the dialogue, Goliath becomes really furious, and is
in haste to transfix David with his spear; while David, on the other hand,
becomes more calm, collected, and observant as the critical moment
approaches, thus denoting his firm and unwavering trust in the God of
Israel. David makes but few gestures, but always assumes a reverential
attitude when he mentions the name of God&mdash;not puritanical by any
means, but expressive of humble hope and smiling confidence.

<h2>THE WIDOW BEDOTT'S POETRY.</h2>

<p class="indright"><b>FRANCES M. WHITCHER.</b></p>

<p style="line-height: 1%; margin-top: -0.5em;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="dropcap" ><span class="dcap">Y</span>
<b>ES</b>,&mdash;he was one o' the best men that ever trod
shoe-leather, husband was, though Miss Jinkins
says (she 't was Poll Bingham), <i>she</i> says, I never
found it out till after he died, but that 's the consarndest
lie, that ever was told, though it 's jest a piece
with everything else she says about me. I guess if
everybody could see the poitry I writ to his memory,
nobody wouldn 't think I dident set store by him.
Want to hear it? Well, I 'll see if I can say it; it
ginerally affects me wonderfully, seems to harrer up
my feelin's; but I'll try. Dident know I ever writ
poitry? How you talk! used to make lots on 't;
hain't so much late years. I remember once when
Parson Potter had a bee, I sent him an amazin'
great cheese, and writ a piece o' poitry, and pasted
on top on 't. It says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Teach him for to proclaim</p>
<p class="i2">Salvation to the folks;</p>
<p>No occasion give for any blame,</p>
<p class="i2">Nor wicked people's jokes.</p>
  </div>  </div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page113" id="page113"></a>[page&nbsp;113]</span>
<p>And so it goes on, but I guess I won't stop to say the
rest on now, seein' there's seven and forty verses.</p>

<p>Parson Potter and his wife was wonderfully pleased
with it; used to sing it to the tune o' Haddem. But
I was gwine to tell the one I made in relation to
husband; it begins as follers:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>He never jawed in all his life,</p>
<p class="i2">He never was unkind,&mdash;</p>
<p>And (tho' I say it that was his wife)</p>
<p class="i2">Such men you seldom find.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>(That's as true as the Scripturs; I never knowed
him to say a harsh word.)</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>I never changed my single lot,&mdash;</p>
<p class="i2">I thought 't would be a sin&mdash;</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>(though widder Jinkins says it's because I never had
a chance.) Now 't ain't for me to say whether I ever
had a numerous number o' chances or not, but
there 's them livin' that <i>might</i> tell if they wos a mind
to; why, this poitry was writ on account of being
joked about Major Coon, three year after husband
died. I guess the ginerality o' folks knows what was
the nature o' Major Coon's feelin's towards me, tho'
his wife and Miss Jinkins <i>does</i> say I tried to ketch
him. The fact is, Miss Coon feels wonderfully cut
up 'cause she knows the Major took her "Jack at a
pinch,"&mdash;seein' he couldent get such as he wanted,
he took such as he could get,&mdash;but I goes on to
say&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>I never changed my single lot,</p>
<p class="i2">I thought 't would be a sin,&mdash;</p>
<p>For I thought so much o' Deacon Bedott,</p>
<p class="i2">I never got married agin.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>If ever a hasty word he spoke,</p>
<p class="i2">His anger dident last,</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page114" id="page114"></a>[page&nbsp;114]</span>
<p>But vanished like tobacker smoke</p>
<p class="i2">Afore the wintry blast.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>And since it was my lot to be</p>
<p class="i2">The wife of such a man,</p>
<p>Tell the men that's after me</p>
<p class="i2">To ketch me if they can.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>If I was sick a single jot,</p>
<p class="i2">He called the doctor in&mdash;</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>That's a fact,&mdash;he used to be scairt to death if
anything ailed me. Now only jest think,&mdash;widder
Jinkins told Sam Pendergrasses wife (she 'twas Sally
Smith) that she guessed the deacon dident set no
great store by me, or he wouldent a went off to confrence
meetin' when I was down with the fever. The
truth is, they couldent git along without him no way.
Parson Potter seldom went to confrence meetin', and
when he wa' n't there, who was ther, pray tell, that
knowed enough to take the lead if husband dident do
it? Deacon Kenipe hadent no gift, and Deacon
Crosby hadent no inclination, and so it all come on
Deacon Bedott,&mdash;and he was always ready and
willin' to do his duty, you know; as long as he was
able to stand on his legs he continued to go to confrence
meetin'; why, I've knowed that man to go
when he couldent scarcely crawl on account o' the
pain in the spine of his back. He had a wonderful
gift, and he wa' n't a man to keep his talents hid up
in a napkin,&mdash;so you see 't was from a sense o' duty
he went when I was sick, whatever Miss Jinkins may
say to the contrary. But where was I? Oh!&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>If I was sick a single jot,</p>
<p class="i2">He called the doctor in&mdash;</p>
<p>I sot so much by Deacon Bedott</p>
<p class="i2">I never got married agin.</p>
  </div>  </div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page115" id="page115"></a>[page&nbsp;115]</span>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>A wonderful tender heart he had,</p>
<p class="i2">That felt for all mankind,&mdash;</p>
<p>It made him feel amazin bad</p>
<p class="i2">To see the world so blind.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>Whiskey and rum he tasted not&mdash;</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>That's as true as the Scripturs,&mdash;but if you'll believe
it, Betsy Ann Kenipe told my Melissy that Miss
Jinkins said one day to their house, how 't she 'd seen
Deacon Bedott high, time and agin! did you ever!
Well, I'm glad nobody don't pretend to mind
anything <i>she</i> says. I've knowed Poll Bingham from
a gall, and she never knowed how to speak the truth&mdash;besides
she always had a pertikkler spite against
husband and me, and between us tew I 'll tell you
why if you won't mention it, for I make it a pint
never to say nothin' to injure nobody. Well she was
a ravin'-distracted after my husband herself, but it's
a long story. I 'll tell you about it some other time,
and then you'll know why widder Jinkins is etarnally
runnin' me down. See,&mdash;where had I got to? Oh, I
remember now,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Whiskey and rum he tasted not,&mdash;</p>
<p class="i2">He thought it was a sin,&mdash;</p>
<p>I thought so much o' Deacon Bedott</p>
<p class="i2">I never got married agin.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>But now he's dead! the thought is killin',</p>
<p class="i2">My grief I can't control&mdash;</p>
<p>He never left a single shillin'</p>
<p class="i2">His widder to console.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>But that wa' n't his fault&mdash;he was so out o' health for
a number o' year afore he died, it ain't to be wondered
at he dident lay up nothin'&mdash;however, it dident
give him no great oneasiness,&mdash;he never cared much
for airthly riches, though Miss Pendergrass says she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page116" id="page116"></a>[page&nbsp;116]</span>
heard Miss Jinkins say Deacon Bedott was as tight
as the skin on his back,&mdash;begrudged folks their
vittals when they came to his house! did you ever!
why, he was the hull-souldest man I ever see in all
my born days. If I'd such a husband as Bill Jinkins
was, I'd hold my tongue about my neighbors'
husbands. He was a dretful mean man, used to git
drunk every day of his life, and he had an awful high
temper,&mdash;used to swear like all posset when he got
mad,&mdash;and I've heard my husband say, (and he
wa' n't a man that ever said anything that wa' n't
true),&mdash;I've heard <i>him</i> say Bill Jinkins would cheat
his own father out of his eye teeth if he had a chance.
Where was I? Oh! "His widder to console,"&mdash;ther
ain't but one more verse, 't ain't a very lengthy
poim. When Parson Potter read it, he says to me,
says he,&mdash;What did you stop so soon for?"&mdash;but
Miss Jinkins told the Crosbys <i>she</i> thought I'd better
a' stopt afore I 'd begun,&mdash;she 's a purty critter to
talk so, I must say. I 'd like to see some poitry o'
hern,&mdash;I guess it would be astonishin' stuff; and
mor'n all that, she said there wa' n't a word o' truth
in the hull on 't,&mdash;said I never cared two cents for the
deacon. What an everlastin' lie!! Why, when he
died, I took it so hard I went deranged, and took on
so for a spell, they was afraid they should have to
send me to a Lunattic Arsenal. But that's a painful
subject, I won't dwell on 't. I conclude as follers:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>I'll never change my single lot,&mdash;</p>
<p class="i2">I think 't would be a sin,&mdash;</p>
<p>The inconsolable widder o' Deacon Bedott</p>
<p class="i2">Don't intend to get married agin.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Excuse me cryin'&mdash;my feelin's always overcomes me
so when I say that poitry&mdash;O-o-o-o-o-o!</p>

<h2>MISS MALONEY ON THE CHINESE QUESTION.</h2>

<p class="indright"><b>MARY MAPES DODGE.</b></p>

<p style="line-height: 1%; margin-top: -0.5em;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="dropcap" ><span class="dcap">O</span>
<b>CH!</b>  don't be talkin'. Is it howld on, ye say?
An' did n't I howld on till the heart o' me was
clane broke entirely, and me wastin' that thin you
could clutch me wid yer two hands? To think o'
me toilin' like a nager for the six year I 've been in
Ameriky,&mdash;bad luck to the day I iver left the owld
counthry! to be bate by the likes o' them (faix an'
I'll sit down when I 'm ready, so I will, Aunt Ryan,
an' yed better be listnin' than drawin' yer remarks)!
an' is it mysel, with five good characters from
respectable places, would be herdin' wid the
haythens? The saints forgive me, but I 'd be buried
alive sooner 'n put up wid it a day longer. Sure an' I
was the granehorn not to be lavin' at onct when the
missus kim into me kitchen wid her perlaver about
the new waiter man which was brought out from
Californy.</p>

<p>"He 'll be here the night," says she, "and, Kitty,
it 's meself looks to you to be kind and patient wid
him, for he 's a furriner," says she, a kind o' lookin'
off.</p>

<p>"Sure an it 's little I 'll hinder nor interfare wid him
nor any other, mum," says I, a kind o' stiff, for I
minded me how these French waiters, wid their paper
collars and brass rings on their fingers, isn 't company
for no gurril brought up dacint and honest.</p>

<p>Och! sorra a bit I knew what was comin' till the
missus walked into me kitchen smilin', and says
kind o' shcared: "Here 's Fing Wing, Kitty, an'
you 'll have too much sinse to mind his bein' a little
strange."</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page120" id="page120"></a>[page&nbsp;120]</span>

<p>Wid that she shoots the door, and I, misthrusting
if I was tidied up sufficient for me fine buy wid his
paper collar, looks up, and&mdash;Howly fathers! may I
niver brathe another breath, but there stud a rale
haythen Chineser a grinnin' like he'd just come off a
tay-box. If you'll belave me, the crayture was that
yeller it ud sicken you to see him; and sorra stitch
was on him but a black nightgown over his trousers,
and the front of his head shaved claner nor a copper
biler, and a black tail a-hangin' down from behind,
wid his two feet stook into the heathenestest shoes
you ever set eyes on.</p>

<p>Och! but I was up stairs afore you could turn
about, a givin' the missus warnin', an' only stopt wid
her by her raisin' me wages two dollars, and playdin'
wid me how it was a Christian's duty to bear wid
haythins and taitch 'em all in our power,&mdash;the saints
have us!</p>

<p>Well, the ways and trials I had wid that Chineser,
Ann Ryan, I couldn't be tellin'. Not a blissed
thing cud I do but he'd be lookin' on wid his eyes
cocked up'ard like two poomp-handles, an' he
widdout a speck or smitch o' whiskers on him, an'
his finger-nails full a yard long. But it 's dyin' you'd
be to see the missus a' larnin' him, and he grinnin'
an' waggin' his pig-tail (which was pieced out long
wid some black stoof, the haythen chate), and gettin'
into her ways wonderful quick, I don't deny, imitatin'
that sharp you'd be shurprised, and ketchin' an'
copyin' things the best of us will do a-hurried wid
work, yet don't want comin' to the knowledge of the
family,&mdash;bad luck to him!</p>

<p>Is it ate wid him? Arrah, an' would I be sittin'
wid a haythen an' he a-atin' wid drum-sticks,&mdash;yes,
an' atin' dogs an' cats unknownst to me, I warrant
you, which it is the custom of them Chinesers, till the
thought made me that sick I could die. An' did n't
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page121" id="page121"></a>[page&nbsp;121]</span>
the crayture proffer to help me a wake ago come
Toosday, an' me a foldin' down me clane clothes for
the ironin', an' fill his haythin mouth wid water, an'
afore I could hinder squirrit it through his teeth stret
over the best linen table-cloth, and fold it up tight,
as innercent now as a baby, the dirrity baste! But
the worrest of all was the copyin' he'd be doin' till
ye'd be dishtracted. It's yersel' knows the tinder feet
that's on me since ever I 've bin in this counthry.
Well, owin' to that, I fell into a way o' slippin' me
shoes off when I 'd be settin' down to pale the praities
or the likes o' that, and, do ye mind! that haythin
would do the same thing after me whiniver the
missus set him to parin' apples or tomaterses. The
saints in heaven could n't have made him belave he
cud kape the shoes on him when he'd be palin'
anything.</p>

<p>Did I lave for that? Faix an' I did n't. Did n't
he get me into trouble wid my missus, the haythin?
You're aware yersel' how the boondles comin' in from
the grocery often contains more 'n 'll go into anything
dacently. So, for that matter, I'd now and then take
out a sup o' sugar, or flour, or tay, an' wrap it in
paper and put it in me bit of a box tucked under the
ironin' blankit the how it cuddent be bodderin' any
one. Well, what shud it be, but this blessed Sathurday
morn the missus wos a spakin' pleasant and
respec'ful wid me in me kitchen when the grocer boy
comes in an' stands fornenst her wid his boondles,
an' she motions like to Fing Wing (which I never
would call him by that name ner any other but just
haythin), she motions to him, she does, for to take

<h2>THE BIG OYSTER.</h2>


<h4>A LEGEND OF RARITAN BAY.</h4>

<p class="indright">GEORGE ARNOLD.</p>


<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<div class="figleft3">
<span style="font-weight: normal">'</span>T</div> <br style="line-height: 30%" />
<p class="i4">&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>WAS</b> a hazy, mazy, lazy day,</p>
<p class="i6">And the good smack <i>Emily</i> idly lay</p>
<p>Off Staten Island, in Raritan Bay,</p>
<p class="i2">With her canvas loosely flapping,</p>
<p>The sunshine slept on the briny deep,</p>
<p>Nor wave nor zephyr could vigils keep,</p>
<p>The oysterman lay on the deck asleep,</p>
<p class="i2">And even the cap'n was napping.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>The smack went drifting down the tide,&mdash;</p>
<p>The waters gurgling along her side,&mdash;</p>
<p>Down where the bay glows vast and wide,&mdash;</p>
<p class="i2">A beautiful sheet of water;</p>
<p>With scarce a ripple about her prow,</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page123" id="page123"></a>[page&nbsp;123]</span>
<p>The oyster-smack floated, silent and slow,</p>
<p>With Keyport far on her starboard bow,</p>
<p class="i2">And South Amboy on her quarter.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>But, all at once, a grating sound</p>
<p>Made the cap'n awake and glance around;</p>
<p>"Hold hard!" cried he, "we've run aground,</p>
<p class="i2">As sure as all tarnation!"</p>
<p>The men jumped up, and grumbled and swore;</p>
<p>They also looked, and plainly saw</p>
<p>That the <i>Emily</i> lay two miles from shore,</p>
<p class="i2">At the smallest calculation.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>Then, gazing over the side, to see</p>
<p>What kind of a bottom this shoal might be,</p>
<p>They saw, in the shadow that lay to the lee,</p>
<p class="i2">A sight that filled them with horror!</p>
<p>The water was clear, and beneath it, there,</p>
<p>An oyster lay in its slimy lair,</p>
<p>So big, that to tell its dimensions fair</p>
<p class="i2">Would take from now till to-morrow.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>And this it was made the grating sound;</p>
<p>On this the <i>Emily</i> ran aground;</p>
<p>And this was the shoal the cap'n found,&mdash;</p>
<p class="i2">Alack! the more is the pity.</p>
<p>For straight an idea entered his head:</p>
<p>He'd drag it out of its watery bed,</p>
<p>And give it a resting-place, instead,</p>
<p class="i2">In some saloon in the city.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>So, with crow, and lever, and gaff, and sling,</p>
<p>And tongs, and tackle, and roller, and ring,</p>
<p>They made a mighty effort to bring</p>
<p class="i2">This hermit out of his cloister.</p>
<p>They labored earnestly, day and night,</p>
<p>Working by torch and lantern light,</p>
<p>Till they had to acknowledge that, do what they might,</p>
<p class="i2">They never could budge the oyster!</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page124" id="page124"></a>[page&nbsp;124]</span>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>The cap'n fretted, and fumed, and fussed,&mdash;</p>
<p>He swore he'd "have that 'yster, or bust!"</p>
<p>But, for all his oaths, he was quite nonplussed;</p>
<p class="i2">So by way of variation,</p>
<p>He sat him quietly down, for a while,</p>
<p>To cool his anger and settle his bile,</p>
<p>And to give himself up, in his usual style,</p>
<p class="i2">To a season of meditation.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>Now, the cap'n was quite a wonderful man;</p>
<p>He could do almost anything any man can,</p>
<p>And a good deal more, when he once began</p>
<p class="i2">To act from a clear deduction.</p>
<p>But his wonderful power,&mdash;his greatest pride,&mdash;</p>
<p>The feat that shadowed all else beside,&mdash;</p>
<p>The talent on which he most relied,&mdash;</p>
<p class="i2">Was his awful power of suction!</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>At suction he never had known defeat!</p>
<p>The stoutest suckers had given in, beat,</p>
<p>When he sucked up a quart of apple-jack, neat,</p>
<p class="i2">By touching his lips to the measure!</p>
<p>He'd suck an oyster out of its shell,</p>
<p>Suck shrimps or lobsters equally well;</p>
<p>Suck cider till inward the barrel-heads fell,&mdash;</p>
<p class="i2">And seemed to find it a pleasure.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>Well, after thinking a day or two,</p>
<p>This doughty sucker imagined he knew</p>
<p>About the best thing he could possibly do,</p>
<p class="i2">To secure the bivalvular hermit.</p>
<p>"I'll bore through his shell, as they bore for coal,</p>
<p>With an auger fixed on the end of a pole,</p>
<p>And then, through a tube, I'll suck him out whole,&mdash;</p>
<p class="i2">A neat little swallow, I term it!"</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>The very next day, he returned to the place</p>
<p>Where his failure had thrown him into disgrace;</p>
<p>And there, with a ghastly grin on his face,</p>
<p class="i2">Began his submarine boring.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page125" id="page125"></a>[page&nbsp;125]</span>
<p>He worked for a week, for the shell was tough,</p>
<p>But reached the interior soon enough</p>
<p>For the oyster, who found such surgery rough,&mdash;</p>
<p class="i2">Such grating, and scraping, and scoring!</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>The shell-fish started, the water flew,</p>
<p>The cap'n turned decidedly blue,</p>
<p>But thrust his auger still further through,</p>
<p class="i2">To quiet the wounded creature.</p>
<p>Alas! I fear my tale grows sad,</p>
<p>The oyster naturally felt quite bad</p>
<p class="i2">In spite of its peaceful nature.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>It arose, and, turning itself on edge,</p>
<p>Exposed a ponderous shelly wedge,</p>
<p>All covered with slime, and sea-weed, and sedge,&mdash;</p>
<p class="i2">A conchological wonder!</p>
<p>This wedge flew open, as quick as a flash,</p>
<p>Into two great jaws, with a mighty splash</p>
<p>One scraunching, crunching, crackling crash,&mdash;</p>
<p class="i2">And the smack was gone to thunder.</p>

<p><i>Miss P.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Ah, Mrs. Gabble! I'm glad to see you.
&nbsp;&nbsp;(<i>Takes chair and sits beside her.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Mrs. G.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;And poor Brown is gone!</p>

<p><i>Miss P.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Brown dead? This is sad news.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. G.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;I should think it was&mdash;and there's
Skillet, the butcher, chopped off his thumb&mdash;and
Miss Pearson fell down stairs and broke her china
sugar-bowl&mdash;sp'ilt the whole set. As I told my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page133" id="page133"></a>[page&nbsp;133]</span>
husband, these expensive dishes never can be
matched&mdash;and speaking of matches, Mrs. Thorpe
is going to get a divorce. Jest think of it! I met
her going into Carter's shop this morning. She
had on that pink muslin he gave her for a birthday
present&mdash;Jenkins has got a new lot of them, only
a shilling a yard&mdash;speaking of yards, old Cooper
tumbled into that miserable well in his back yard
this morning. They pulled him out&mdash;speaking of
pulling, Miss Tibbet was in to the dentist's this
morning for a new set of teeth, and&mdash;Have you
seen my Sis?</p>

<p><i>Miss P.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;O, yes. She's in the kitchen with Juno.
And, speaking of Sissy, reminds me that I must
thank you for sending me&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mrs. G.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;My pickles? Yes. Well, I'm glad
you got 'em. But I didn't have a bit of good luck
with 'em. And, speaking of pickles, O, Miss Pease,
that villain, Smith, the grocer, has been taken up.
He's going to be hung. Nothing can save him.</p>

<p><i>Miss P.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Smith arrested! For what pray?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. G.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;P'isoning! Jest think of it! And he
a deacon in the church, and has such a splendid
span of horses, and such an elegant beach wagon.
I declare, the last time he took us to the beach I
nearly died eating soft-shelled crabs; and my
husband tumbled overboard, and Mr. Brown got
sunstruck; and now he's gone! Dear me, dear me!
And my washing ain't out yet.</p>

<p><i>Miss P.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;But tell me, Mrs. Gabble, what is it
about the poisoning?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. G.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Why, he or somebody else has been putting
prussic acid in his vinegar, just at the time, too,
when everybody's making pickles; and there's no
end of the p'isoning he will have to answer for.
Mrs. Jewel's just sent for the doctor, and Mrs.
Poor's been dreadful all day, and Dr. Baldtop's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page134" id="page134"></a>[page&nbsp;134]</span>
flying round from house to house; and, O, dear&mdash;there's
my washing! Who'll be the next victim
nobody knows, I'm sure.</p>

<p><i>Sadie.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;(<i>Jumping up.</i>) &nbsp;&nbsp;O, dear! O, dear!
Send for the doctor, quick! I'm dying, I know
I am. &nbsp;&nbsp;(<i>Runs across stage and sinks into chair</i>,

<p><i>Miss P.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;(<i>Running to her.</i>) &nbsp;&nbsp;Bless me child, what
ails you?</p>

<p><i>Sadie.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;I don't know; I can't tell. The doctor,
quick!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. G.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Deary me, she's took sudden, just for
all the world like Susan Richie.</p>

<p><i>Jenny.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;(<i>Jumping up.</i>) &nbsp;&nbsp;Water, water! Give

sudden&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Bessie.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;(<i>Jumping up.</i>) &nbsp;&nbsp;O, my throat! I'm

Juno! Quick!</p>

<p class="center1"><i>Enter</i> <span class="sc">Juno, l</span>.</p>

<p><i>Juno.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Here I is, Missy Pease.</p>

<p><i>Jenny.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;No, no! Get me some water&mdash;quick!</p>

<p><i>Juno.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;(<i>Running</i> <span class="sc">L.</span>) &nbsp;&nbsp;To be sure, honey; to
be sure.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page135" id="page135"></a>[page&nbsp;135]</span>

<p><i>Bessie.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;No, no, Juno! some ipecac, or a stomach
pump.</p>

<p><i>Juno.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Pump, pump! Want de pump? I'll
fetch it, I'll fetch it. Bress my soul, I'll fetch
something.</p>
<p class="indright"><i>Exit</i>, <span class="sc">L.</span></p>

<p><i>Mrs. G.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Well, if this ain't drefful!&mdash;washing-day,
too&mdash;and the undertaker's jest as busy as he
can be&mdash;there never was so much <i>immortality</i> in
this place, never. Poor critters! poor critters!</p>

<p><i>Miss P.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Girls, what does this mean?</p>

<p><i>Sadie.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;O, Miss Pease, such agony!</p>

<p><i>Bessie.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;O, dear, what will become of me?</p>

<p><i>Jenny.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;O, this dreadful parching in the throat!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. G.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;O, I know it, I know it. I told my
husband that something dreadful was a goin' to
happen when he sold that colt yesterday.</p>

<p><i>Miss P.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Sadie, what is the meaning of this.
Your pulse is regular, your head cool, and your
tongue clear.</p>

<p><i>Sadie.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;O, Miss Pease, it's those dreadful
pickles.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. G.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, indeed, it is a drefful pickle&mdash;and
so sudden, jest for all the world like poor Mr.
Brown's sudden took, and these always seem to end
fatally at some time or other&mdash;Dear me, dear me,
and my wash&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Miss P.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Pickles! Have you disobeyed me?</p>

<p><i>Sadie.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;I couldn't help it, Miss Pease; they
looked so tempting. But I only took one.</p>

<p><i>Bessie.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;And I only tasted that.</p>

<p><i>Jenny.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;I only had one good bite.</p>

<p><i>Sadie.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;And we are poisoned!</p>

<p><i>Bessie.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;O, dear! poisoned!</p>

<p><i>Jenny.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, poisoned!</p>

<p><i>Miss P.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;How, poisoned?</p>

<p><i>Sadie.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs. Gabble says the vinegar was poisoned
by Mr. Smith.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page136" id="page136"></a>[page&nbsp;136]</span>

<p><i>Mrs. G.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Smith&mdash;vinegar&mdash;p'isoned! The land
sakes! And I a good church member&mdash;and my
washing&mdash;and poor Mr. Brown, tew. Well, I
never! I'd have you to know that I bought no
vinegar of Mr. Smith, I made my own.</p>

<p><i>Sadie.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;And your pickles were not poisoned?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. G.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;No, indeed. Never did such a thing in
my life.</p>

<p><i>Sadie.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;O, dear! I'm so glad! &nbsp;&nbsp;(<i>Jumping up.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Bessie.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;I won't have the ipecac. &nbsp;&nbsp;(<i>Rises.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Jenny.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;My throat is decidedly better. &nbsp;&nbsp;(<i>Rises.</i>)</p>

<p class="center1"><i>Enter</i> <span class="sc">Juno</span> <i>with a pail of water and a dipper.</i></p>

<p><i>Juno.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Bress my soul, de pump was fastened
down so tight couldn't git it up. Here's a pail of
water; if dat won't do I'll git a tub.</p>

<p><i>Miss P.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;No matter, Juno. I think 'twill not be
needed. Young ladies, I am very sorry&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Sadie.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Please, Miss Pease, do not speak of it.
I alone am to blame for transgressing your command,
for such we should consider it, as you are for
the present our guardian. Forgive me, and in future
I will endeavour to control my appetite, and comply
with your wishes.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. G.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I declare, I don't see the harm
in eating pickles. My girls eat their weight in 'em,
and they're just as sweet-tempered as&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Miss P.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Their mother. Mrs. Gabble, it is not
a question of harm, but of obedience, here. You
see, the young ladies accept me as their guardian,
and I only forbid that which I think their parents
would not approve.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. G.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;And there's my washing in the suds!
Where's my Sis.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page137" id="page137"></a>[page&nbsp;137]</span>

<p class="center1"><span class="indent1"><i>Enter</i></span> <span class="sc">Sissy Gabble, l.</span>, <i>with a large slice of bread,

<p><i>Mrs. G.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Yes; and the 'lasses running all over
the clothes! Come, Sissy, let's go home. I'm sorry,
Miss Pease, you don't like pickles; and I'm sorry,
young ladies, they disagree with you. And I'm
sorry, Miss Pease, I left my washing.</p>

<p><i>Miss P.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Now don't be sorry at all, Mrs. Gabble.
I'm always glad to see you. Your gift was well-intended,
and the young ladies have suffered no
harm, perhaps received a wholesome lesson.</p>

<p><i>Sadie.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;I think we have. I shall be very careful
what I touch.</p>

<p><i>Jenny.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;O, dear! such a fright! I shall never
get over it.</p>

<p><i>Bessie.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;O, Sadie, you thought it was so nice!</p>

<p><i>Jenny.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, such a Precious Pickle!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. G.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Of course it was. My pickles are the
best made in town&mdash;precious nice, I tell you. Mrs.
Doolittle always sends in for 'em when she has company;
and the minister says they're awful soothing
arter sermon.</p>

<p><i>Sadie.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;O, certainly; I've no doubt of it. But
I've found that <i>stolen</i> fruit is not the sweetest, and
that mischievous fingers make trouble when they
clutch what mine sought, and <i>made</i> a Precious
Pickle.</p>

<h2>ENLISTING AS ARMY NURSE.</h2>

<p class="indright"><b>LOUISA M. ALCOTT.</b></p>

<p style="line-height: 1%; margin-top: -0.5em;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="dropcap" ><span class="dcap">I</span>
&nbsp;<b>WANT</b> something to do."&mdash;This remark being
addressed to the world in general, no one in
particular felt it his duty to reply; so I repeated it
to the smaller world about me, received the following
suggestions, and settled the matter by answering
my own inquiry, as people are apt to do when very
much in earnest.</p>

<p>"Write a book," quoth my father.</p>

<p>"Don't know enough, sir. First live, then
write."</p>

<p>"Try teaching again," suggested my mother.</p>

<p>"No, thank you, ma'am; ten years of that is
enough."</p>

<p>"Take a husband like my Darby, and fulfil your
mission," said Sister Jane, home on a visit.</p>

<p>"Can't afford expensive luxuries, Mrs. Coobiddy."</p>

<p>"Turn actress, and immortalize your name," said
Sister Vashti, striking an attitude.</p>

<p>"I won't."</p>

<p>"Go nurse the soldiers," said my young neighbor,
Tom, panting for "the tented field."</p>

<p>"I will!"</p>

<p>Arriving at this satisfactory conclusion, the
meeting adjourned; and the fact that Miss Tribulation
was available as army nurse went abroad on
the wings of the wind.</p>

<p>In a few days a townswoman heard of my desire,
approved of it, and brought about an interview with
one of the sisterhood I wished to join, who was at
home on a furlough, and able and willing to satisfy
inquiries.</p>

<p>A morning chat with Miss General S.&mdash;we hear
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page140" id="page140"></a>[page&nbsp;140]</span>
no end of Mrs. Generals, why not a Miss?&mdash;produced
three results: I felt that I could do the
work, was offered a place, and accepted it; promising
not to desert, but to stand ready to march on
Washington at an hour's notice.</p>

<p>A few days were necessary for the letter
containing my request and recommendation to
reach head-quarters, and another, containing my
commission, to return; therefore no time was to
be lost; and, heartily thanking my pair of friends,
I hurried home through the December slush, as
if the Rebels were after me, and, like many
another recruit, burst in upon my family with the
announcement,&mdash;"I've enlisted!"</p>

<p>An impressive silence followed. Tom, the
irrepressible, broke it with a slap on the shoulder
and the grateful compliment,&mdash;"Old Trib, you're a
trump!"</p>

<p>"Thank you; then I'll <i>take</i> something,"&mdash;which
I did, in the shape of dinner, reeling off my news
at the rate of three dozen words to a mouthful;
and as every one else talked equally fast, and
all together, the scene was most inspiring.</p>

<p>As boys going to sea immediately become nautical
in speech, walk as if they already had their sea-legs
on, and shiver their timbers on all possible
occasions, so I turned military at once, called my
dinner my rations, saluted all new-comers, and
ordered a dress-parade that very afternoon.</p>

<p>Having reviewed every rag I possessed, I detailed
some pieces for picket duty while airing on the
fence; some to the sanitary influences of the wash-tub;
others to mount guard in the trunk; while
the weak and wounded went to the Work-basket
Hospital, to be made ready for active service
again.</p>

<p>To this squad I devoted myself for a week;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page141" id="page141"></a>[page&nbsp;141]</span>
but all was done, and I had time to get powerfully
impatient before the letter came. It did arrive,
however, and brought a disappointment along with
<ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'it's'">its</ins> good-will and
friendliness; for it told me that
the place in the Armory Hospital that I supposed I
was to take was already filled, and a much less
desirable one at Hurly-burly House was offered
instead.</p>

<p>"That's just your luck, Trib. I'll take your
trunk up garret for you again; for of course you
won't go," Tom remarked, with the disdainful
pity which small boys affect when they get into
their teens.</p>

<p>I was wavering in my secret soul; but that
remark settled the matter, and I crushed him on
the spot with martial brevity,&mdash;"It is now one;
I shall march at six."</p>

<p>I have a confused recollection of spending the
afternoon in pervading the house like an executive
whirlwind, with my family swarming after me,&mdash;all
working, talking, prophesying, and lamenting
while I packed such of my things as I was to take
with me, tumbled the rest into two big boxes,
danced on the lids till they shut, and gave them
in charge, with the direction,&mdash;"If I never come
back, make a bonfire of them."</p>

<p>Then I choked down a cup of tea, generously
salted instead of sugared by some agitated relative,
shouldered my knapsack,&mdash;it was only a travelling-bag,
but do let me preserve the unities,&mdash;hugged
my family three times all round without a vestige
of unmanly emotion, till a certain dear old lady
broke down upon my neck, with a despairing sort
of wail,&mdash;"O my dear, my dear! how can I let
you go?"</p>

<p>"I'll stay, if you say so, mother."</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page142" id="page142"></a>[page&nbsp;142]</span>

<p>"But I don't; go, and the Lord will take care
of you."</p>

<p>Much of the Roman matron's courage had gone
into the Yankee matron's composition, and, in spite
of her tears, she would have sent ten sons to the
war, had she possessed them, as freely as she sent
one daughter, smiling and flapping on the door-step
till I vanished, though the eyes that followed me
were very dim, and the handkerchief she waved
was very wet.</p>

<p>My transit from The Gables to the village depot
was a funny mixture of good wishes and good-bys,
mud-puddles and shopping. A December twilight
is not the most cheering time to enter upon a
somewhat perilous enterprise; but I'd no thought
of giving out, O, bless you, no!</p>

<p>When the ingine screeched "Here we are!" I
clutched my escort in a fervent embrace, and
skipped into the car with as blithe a farewell as
if going on a bridal tour,&mdash;though I believe brides
don't usually wear cavernous black bonnets and
fuzzy brown coats, with a hair-brush, a pair of
rubbers, two books, and a bag of gingerbread
distorting the pockets.</p>

<p>If I thought that people would believe it, I'd
boldly state that I slept from C. to B., which would
simplify matters immensely; but as I know they
wouldn't, I'll confess that the head under the
funereal coal-hod fermented with all manner of
high thoughts and heroic purposes "to do or die,"&mdash;perhaps
both; and the heart under the fuzzy
brown coat felt very tender with the memory of
the dear old lady, probably sobbing over her army
socks and the loss of her topsy-turvy Trib.</p>

<p>At this juncture I took the veil, and what I did
behind it is nobody's business; but I maintain
that the soldier who cries when his mother says
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page143" id="page143"></a>[page&nbsp;143]</span>
"Good by" is the boy to fight best, and die
bravest, when the time comes, or go back to her
better than he went.</p>

<p><i>Patrick.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Throth, I was thinkin' so myself.
And now, Captain jewel, it is I that wishes we had a
gridiron.</p>

<p><i>Captain.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Why, Patrick, what puts the notion of a
gridiron into your head?</p>

<p><i>Patrick.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Because I'm starving with hunger,
Captain dear.</p>

<p><i>Captain.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Surely you do not intend to eat a
gridiron, do you?</p>

<p><i>Patrick.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Ate a gridiron; bad luck to it! no.
But if we had a gridiron, we could dress a beefsteak.</p>

<p><i>Captain.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Yes; but where's the beefsteak,
Patrick?</p>

<p><i>Patrick.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Sure, couldn't we cut it off the pork?</p>

<p><i>Captain.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;I never thought of that. You are a
clever fellow, Patrick. &nbsp;&nbsp;(<i>Laughing.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Patrick.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;There's many a thrue word said in joke,
Captain. And now, if you will go and get the bit of
pork that we saved from the rack, I'll go to the house
there beyant, and ax some of them to lind me the
loan of a gridiron.</p>

<p><i>Captain.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;But, Patrick, this is France, and they
are all foreigners here.</p>

<p><i>Patrick.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Well, and how do you know but I am as
good a furriner myself as any o' them.</p>

<p><i>Captain.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;What do you mean, Patrick?</p>

<p><i>Patrick.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Parley voo frongsay?</p>

<p><i>Captain.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;O, you understand French, then, is it?</p>

<p><i>Patrick.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Throth, you may say that, Captain
dear.</p>

<p>Captain. &nbsp;&nbsp;Well, Patrick, success to you. Be civil
to the foreigners, and I'll be back with the pork in a
minute.</p>
<p class="indright">
 [<i>He goes out.</i></p>

<p><i>Patrick.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Ay, sure enough, I'll be civil to
them; for the Frinch are always mighty p'lite
intirely, and I'll show them I know what good

<h2>THE FORGING OF THE ANCHOR.</h2>

<p class="i4">The bellows ceased, the flames decreased&mdash;though on the forge's brow</p>
<p>The little flames still fitfully play through the sable mound,</p>
<p>And fitfully you still may see the grim smiths ranking round;</p>
<p>All clad in leathern panoply, their broad hands only bare&mdash;</p>
<p>Some rest upon their sledges here, some work the windlass there.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>The windlass strains the tackle chains, the black mound heaves below,</p>
<p>And red and deep a hundred veins burst out at every throe!</p>
<p>It rises, roars, rends all outright&mdash;O, Vulcan, what a glow:</p>
<p>'Tis blinding white, 'tis blasting bright&mdash;the high sun shines not so!</p>
<p>The high sun sees not, on the earth, such fiery fearful show;</p>
<p>The roof-ribs swart, the candent hearth, the ruddy lurid row</p>
<p>Of smiths that stand, an ardent band, like men before the foe</p>
<p>As, quivering through his fleece of flame, the sailing-monster slow</p>

<p>The leathern mail rebounds the hail, the rattling cinders strow</p>
<p>The ground around: at every bound the sweltering fountains flow</p>

<p>The low reef roaring on her lee&mdash;the roll of ocean poured</p>
<p>From stem to stern, sea after sea; the mainmast by the board;</p>
<p>The bulwarks down, the rudder gone, the boats stove at the chains!</p>
<p>But courage still, brave mariners&mdash;the bower yet remains!</p>

<h2>LORD DUNDREARY AT BRIGHTON.</h2>

<h4>AND THE RIDDLE HE MADE THERE.</h4>

<p style="line-height: 1%; margin-top: -0.5em;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="dropcap" ><span class="dcap">O</span>
<b>NE</b> of the many popular delusions wespecting the
Bwitish swell is the supposition that he leads an
independent life,&mdash;goes to bed when he likes, gets
up when he likes, d-dwesses how he likes, and dines
when he pleases.</p>

<p>The public are gwossly deceived on this point. A
weal swell is as m-much under authowity as a p-poor
devil of a pwivate in the marines, a clerk in a government
office, or a f-forth-form boy at Eton. Now I
come under the demon&mdash;demonima&mdash;(no,&mdash;thop,&mdash;what
is the word?)&mdash;dom&mdash;denom&mdash;d-denomination,
that 'th it&mdash;I come under the d-denomination of a
swell&mdash;(in&mdash;in fact&mdash;a <i>howwid</i> swell&mdash;some of my
friends call me, but <i>that'th</i> only their flattewy), and
I assure you a f-fellah in that capacity is so much
westained by rules of f-fashion, that he can scarcely
call his eyeglath his own. A swell, I take it, is a
fellah who t-takes care that he swells as well as
swells who swell as well as he, (there's thuch lot of
thwelling in that thentence,&mdash;ha, ha!&mdash;it's what you
might c-call a busting definition). What I mean is,
that a f-fellah is obliged to do certain things at certain
times of the year, whether he likes 'em or no.
For instance, in the season I've got to go to a lot of
balls and dwums and tea-fights in town, that I don't
care a bit about, and show myself in the Park wegularly
evewy afternoon; and latht month I had to
victimize mythelf down in the countwy,&mdash;shooting (a
bwutal sort of amusement, by the way). Well, about
the end of October evewy one goes to Bwighton, n-no
one knowth why,&mdash;that'th the betht of it,&mdash;and so I
had to go too,&mdash;that's the wortht of it,&mdash;ha, ha!</p>

<p>Not that it's such a b-bad place after all,&mdash;I d-dare
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page152" id="page152"></a>[page&nbsp;152]</span>
say if I hadn't <i>had</i> to go I should have gone all the
same, for what is a f-fellah to do who ith n't much of
a sportsman just about this time? There 'th
n-nothing particular going on in London. Evewything
is b-beathly dull; so I thought I would just
run down on the Southeastern Wailway to be&mdash;ha,
ha!&mdash;Bwightoned up a bit. (Come, th-that's not bad
for an impromptu!)</p>

<p>B-Bwighton was invented in the year 1784, by his
Woyal Highness George P-Pwince of Wales,&mdash;the
author of the shoebuckle, the stand-up collar (a
b-beathly inconvenient and cut-throat thort of a
machine), and a lot of other exthploded things. He
built the Pavilion down there, which looks like a lot
of petrified onions from Bwobdinag clapped down
upon a guard-house. There'th a jolly sort of garden
attached to the building, in which the b-band plays
twice a week, and evewy one turns in there about
four o'clock, so I went too (n-not <i>too</i> o'clock, you
know, but f-four o'clock). I&mdash;I'm vewy fond of
m-martial music, mythelf. I like the dwums and the
t-twombones, and the ophicleides, and all those sort
of inshtwuments,&mdash;yeth, ethpethelly the bwass ones,&mdash;they're
so vewy exthpiring, they are. Thtop
though, ith it expiring or <i>p-per</i>thpiring?&mdash;n-neither
of 'em sound quite right. Oh! I have it now, it&mdash;it's
<i>in</i>thspiring,&mdash;that'th what it is, because the
f-fellahs <i>bweathe into them</i>!</p>

<p>That weminds me of a widdle I made down there
(I&mdash;I've taken to widdles lately, and weally it'th a
vewy harmleth thort of a way of getting thwough the
morning, and it amuthes two f-fellahs at onth,
because if&mdash;if you athk a fellah a widdle, and he
can't guess it, you can have a jolly good laugh at
<i>him</i>, and&mdash;if he&mdash;if he <i>doth</i> guess it, he&mdash;I mean you&mdash;no&mdash;that
is the widdle&mdash;stop, I&mdash;I'm getting confuthed,&mdash;where
wath I? Oh! I know. If&mdash;if he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page153" id="page153"></a>[page&nbsp;153]</span>
<i>doth</i> guess it.... however it ithn't vewy likely he
would&mdash;so what's the good of thupposing impwobabilities?)
Well, thith was the widdle I made,&mdash;I
thed to Sloper (Sloper's a fwiend of mine,&mdash;a vewy
gook thort of fellah Sloper is,&mdash;I d-don't know exactly
what his pwofession would be called, but hith uncle
got him into a b-berth where he gets f-five hundred a
year,&mdash;f-for doing nothing&mdash;s-somewhere&mdash;I forget
where&mdash;but I&mdash;I know he does it),&mdash;I said to Sloper,
"Why is that f-fellah with the b-bassooon l-like his
own instrument?" and Sloper said, "How&mdash;how the
dooth should I know?" (Ha, ha!&mdash;I thought he'd
give it up!) So I said to Sloper, "Why, b-because
they both get <i>blown</i>&mdash;in <i>time</i>!" <i>You</i> thee the joke,
of course, but I don't think Sloper did, thomhow; all
he thed was, "V-vewy mild, Dundreary,"&mdash;and t-tho&mdash;it
was mild&mdash;thertainly, <i>f-for October</i>, but I d-don't
thee why a f-fellah should go making wemarks about
the weather instead of laughing at m-my widdle.</p>

<p>In this pwomenade that I was speaking of, you see
such a lot of thtunning girls evewy afternoon,&mdash;dwessed
twemendous swells, and looking like&mdash;yes,
by Jove! l-like angels in cwinoline,&mdash;there 'th no
other word for it. There are two or thwee always
<i>will</i> l-laugh, somehow, when I meet them,&mdash;they do
now <i>weally</i>. I&mdash;I almost fancy they wegard me with
intewest. I mutht athk Sloper if he can get me an
introduction. Who knowth? pwaps I might make
an impwession,&mdash;I'll twy,&mdash;I&mdash;I've got a little converthathional
power,&mdash;and <i>theveral</i> new wethcoats.</p>

<p>Bwighton is filling fast now. You see dwoves of
ladies evewy day on horseback, widing about in all
diwections. By the way, I&mdash;I muthn't forget to
mention that I met those two girls that always laugh
when they thee me, at a tea-fight. One of 'em&mdash;the
young one&mdash;told me, when I was intwoduced to her,&mdash;in&mdash;in
confidence, mind,&mdash;that she had often heard
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page154" id="page154"></a>[page&nbsp;154]</span>
of me and of my <i>widdles</i>. Tho you thee I'm getting
quite a weputathun that way. The other morning, at
Mutton's, she wath ch-chaffing me again, and
begging me to tell her the latetht thing in widdles.
Now, I hadn't heard any mythelf for thome time, tho
I couldn't give her any <i>vewy</i> great novelty, but a
fwiend of mine made one latht theason which I
thought wather neat, tho I athked her, When ith a
jar not a jar? Thingularly enough, the moment she
heard thith widdle she burtht out laughing behind
her pocket-handkerchief!</p>

<p>"Good gwacious! what'th the matter?" said I.
"Have you ever heard it before?"</p>

<p>"Never," she said emphatically, "in that form;
do, <i>please</i> tell me the answer."</p>

<p>So I told her,&mdash;When it ith a door! Upon which
she&mdash;she went off again in hystewics. I&mdash;I&mdash;I never
<i>did</i> see such a girl for laughing. I know it's a good
widdle, but I didn't think it would have such an
effect as <i>that</i>.</p>

<p>By the way, Sloper told me afterwards that he
thought <i>he</i> had heard the widdle before, somewhere,
but it was put in a different way. He said it was:
When ith a door not a door?&mdash;and the answer,
When it ith ajar!</p>

<p>I&mdash;I've been thinking over the matter lately, and
though I dare thay it&mdash;d-don't much matter which
way the question is put, still&mdash;pwaps the last f-form
is the betht. It&mdash;it seems to me to <i>wead</i> better.
What do you think?</p>

<p>Now I weckomember, I made thuch a jolly widdle
the other day on the Ethplanade. I thaw a fellah
with a big New&mdash;Newfoundland dog, and he inthpired
me&mdash;the dog, you know, not the fellah,&mdash;he wath a
lunatic. I'm keeping the widdle, but I don't mind
telling <i>you</i>.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page155" id="page155"></a>[page&nbsp;155]</span>

<p>Why does a dog waggle hith tail? Give it up?
I think motht fellahs will give that up!</p>

<p>You thee, the dog waggles hith tail becauth the
dog's stwonger than the tail. If he wath n't, the tail
would waggle the dog!</p>

<p>Ye-th,&mdash;that 'th what I call a widdle. If I can only
wecollect him, I thall athtonish those two girls thome
of these days.</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<div class="figleft3">
I</div><br style="line-height: 30%" />
<p class="i2">&nbsp;<b>FOUND</b> my friend in his easy chair,</p>
<p class="i4">With his heart and his head undisturbed by a care;</p>
<p>The smoke of a Cuba outpoured from his lips,</p>
<p>His face like the moon in a semi-eclipse;</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page157" id="page157"></a>[page&nbsp;157]</span>
<p>His feet, in slippers, as high as his nose,</p>
<p>And his chair tilted back to a classical pose.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>I marvelled much such contentment to see&mdash;</p>
<p>The secret whereof I begged he'd give me.</p>
<p>He puffed away with re-animate zest,</p>
<p>As though with an added jollity blest.</p>
<p>"I'll tell you, my friend," said he, in a pause,</p>
<p>"What is the very 'identical' cause.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>"Don't fret!&mdash;Let this be the first rule of your life;&mdash;</p>
<p>Don't fret with your children, don't fret with your wife;</p>
<p>Let everything happen as happen it may,</p>
<p>Be cool as a cucumber every day;</p>
<p>If favourite of fortune or a thing of its spite,</p>
<p>Keep calm, and believe that all is just right.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>"If you're blown up abroad or scolded at home,</p>
<p>Just make up your mind to let it all come:</p>
<p>If people revile you or pile on offence,</p>
<p>'Twill not make any odds a century hence.</p>
<p>For all the reviling that malice can fling,</p>
<p>A little philosophy softens the sting.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>"Run never in debt, but pay as you go;</p>
<p>A man free from debt feels a heaven below;</p>
<p>He rests in a sunshine undimmed by a dun,</p>
<p>And ranks 'mid the favoured as A No. 1.</p>
<p>It needs a great effort the spirit to brace</p>
<p>'Gainst the terror that dwells in a creditor's face.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>"And this one resolve you should cherish like gold,</p>
<p>&mdash;It has ever my life and endeavour controlled,&mdash;</p>
<p>If fortune assail, and worst comes to worst,</p>
<p>And business proves bad, its bubbles all burst,</p>
<p>Be resolved, if disaster your plans circumvent,</p>
<p>That you will, if you fail, owe no man a cent."</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>There was Bunsby's deep wisdom revealed in his tone,</p>
<p>Though its depth was hard to fathom I own;</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page158" id="page158"></a>[page&nbsp;158]</span>
<p>"For how can I fail," I said to myself,</p>
<p>"If to pay all my debts I have enough pelf?"</p>
<p>Then I scratched my sinciput, battling for light,</p>
<p>But gave up the effort, supposing 'twas right;</p>
<p>And herein give out, as my earnest intent,</p>
<p>Whenever I fail to owe no man a cent.</p>

<p class="i4"><b>SEEDY</b> old beggar asked alms of me</p>
<p class="i6">As he sat 'neath the shade of a wayside tree.</p>
<p>He was beggared in purse and beggared in soul,</p>
<p>And his voice betrayed a pitiful dole,</p>
<p>As he sang a song, to a dismal pitch,</p>
<p>With the burden, "<span class="sc">If things was only sich</span>!"</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>"If things was only sich," said he,</p>
<p>"You should see what a wonderful man I'd be;</p>
<p>No beggar I, by the wayside thrown,</p>
<p>But I'd live in a palace and millions own,</p>
<p>And men would court me if I were rich&mdash;</p>
<p>As I'd be if things was only sich."</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>"If things was only sich," said he,</p>
<p>"I'd be lord of the land and lord of the sea;</p>
<p>I would have a throne and be a king,</p>
<p>And rule the roast with a mighty swing&mdash;</p>
<p>I'd make a place in Fame's bright niche;</p>
<p>I'd do it if things was only sich."</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>"If things was only sich," said he,</p>
<p>"Rare wines I'd quaff from the far countree,</p>
<p>I'd cloth myself in dazzling garb,</p>
<p>I'd mount the back of the costly barb,</p>
<p>And none should ask me wherefore or which&mdash;</p>
<p>Did it chance that things was only sich."</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page159" id="page159"></a>[page&nbsp;159]</span>

<p>"If things was only sich," said he,</p>

<p>Yon dame, with a smile that warms my heart,</p>
<p>Might have borne with me life's better part,</p>
<p>But lost to me, here in poverty's ditch,</p>
<p>What were mine if things was only sich."</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>Thus the old beggar moodily sung,</p>
<p>And his eyes dropped tears as his hands he wrung.</p>
<p>I could but pity to hear him berate,</p>
<p>In dolorous tones the decrees of Fate,</p>
<p>That laid on his back its iron switch,</p>
<p>While he cried, "If things was only sich."</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>"If things was only sich!"&mdash;e'en all</p>
<p>Might the past in sad review recall;</p>
<p>But little the use and little the gain,</p>

<p>And whether we're poor or whether we're rich,</p>
<p>We'll say not, "If things was only sich."</p>

<p><i>Ralph.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Twenty minutes of nine. I can take it
easy this morning. How glad I am I staid at home
last night and studied "Spartacus." It's Declamation
Day, and I want to win the highest mark. If I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page165" id="page165"></a>[page&nbsp;165]</span>
fail, it will not be for want of study. I believe I'm
all right. (<i>Declaims.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Charley.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;(<i>Clapping his hands.</i>) &nbsp;&nbsp;Bravo! Bravo!
Spartacus. "They do well to call <i>you</i> chief!" number
one in arithmetic, history, and geography; and
to-day I've no doubt we shall call you number one in
declamation.</p>

<p><i>Ralph.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Ah, Charley, glad to see you. Are you
all ready for the contest?</p>

<p><i>Charley.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, Ralph. (<i>Declaims.</i>)</p>

<div class="poem1">  <div class="stanza">
<p>"Again to the battle, Achaians;</p>
<p>Our hearts bid the tyrants defiance."</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p><i>Ralph.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;I see "a foeman worthy of my steel."
Well, Charley, good luck to you.</p>

<p><i>Charley.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;The same to you. I believe we are
about equally matched. I want to take the highest
mark, but if I am to be defeated, there's no one to
whom I'd sooner surrender the "victor's laurels"
than to you.</p>

<p><i>Ralph.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;And I can heartily say the same of you;
but we must both look out. John Ray told the boys
yesterday he was bound to have the highest mark.</p>

<p><i>Charley.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;I don't fear him.</p>

<p><i>Ralph.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;But he's a good declaimer, Charley.</p>

<p><i>Charley.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;I'll acknowledge that; but you know
he's a terrible fellow for putting off study until the
last moment. It was only yesterday morning Master
Jones decided to have declamation to-day. The
only time we had to prepare was yesterday noon,
last night, and this morning.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page166" id="page166"></a>[page&nbsp;166]</span>

<p><i>Ralph.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Time enough, Charley.</p>

<p><i>Charley.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Certainly. But I know John Ray hasn't
employed it. Yesterday noon he went boating; last
night I'm afraid he visited Hopkins's melon patch;
and this morning I saw him from my window playing
ball.</p>

<p><i>Ralph.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Then we've not much to fear from him;
but here he is, puffing like a porpoise.</p>

<p class="center1"><i>Enter</i> <span class="sc">John Ray, l.</span>, <i>with a book.</i></p>

<p><i>John.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Hallo, boys! what's the time?</p>

<p><i>Charley.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Eighteen minutes of nine. All ready
for the declamation?</p>

<p><i>John.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Not yet; there's time enough.</p>

<p><i>Ralph.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Time enough! What have you selected?</p>

<p><i>John.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;"Tell's Address." I'm going to pitch
into it now. I can do it in eighteen minutes.</p>

<p><i>Charley.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Why, you haven't left it till now?</p>

<p><i>John.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Of course I have. Time enough, I tell
you. I've got a locomotive memory, you know.
None of your slow coaches. I shall only have to
read it over two or three times.</p>

<p><i>Ralph.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;But why didn't you take it up before?</p>

<p><i>John.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;What's the use? I went boating yesterday;
and last night I went&mdash;somewhere else.</p>

<p><i>Charley.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Yes! you took a <i>melon</i>choly walk.
Hey, John?</p>

<p><i>John.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;What do you mean by that?</p>

<p><i>Charley.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;No matter. You'd better study Tell's
Address, if you expect to be ready by nine o'clock.</p>

<p><i>John.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;So I had. Well, you run along, and let
me have this place to myself. It's a quiet place.
So good by. I'll see you by nine o'clock, with Tell's
Address perfect.</p>

<p><i>Charley.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Well, good luck to you. Come Ralph.</p>

<p><i>Ralph.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;I say, Ray; what's the proverb about
the "thief of time"?</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page167" id="page167"></a>[page&nbsp;167]</span>

<p><i>John.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Who do you call a thief?</p>

along Charley.</p>

<h2>THE RAIN-DROPS.</h2>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<div class="figleft3">
A</div> <br style="line-height: 30%" />
<p class="i4"><b>FARMER</b> had a field of corn of rather large extent,</p>
<p class="i6">In tending which, with anxious care, much time and toil he spent;</p>
<p>But after working long and hard, he saw, with grief and pain,</p>
<p>His corn began to droop and fade, because it wanted rain.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>So sad and restless was his mind, at home he could not stop,</p>
<p>But to his field repaired each day to view his withering crop.</p>
<p>One day, when he stood looking up, despairing, at the sky,</p>
<p>Two little rain-drops in the clouds his sad face chanced to spy.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>"I very sorry feel," said one, "to see him look so sad;</p>
<p>I wish I could do him some good; indeed, I should be glad.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page173" id="page173"></a>[page&nbsp;173]</span>
<p>Just see the trouble he has had; and if it should not rain,</p>
<p>Why, all his toil, and time, and care he will have spent in vain."</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>"What use are you," cried number two, "to water so much ground?</p>
<p>You're nothing but a drop of rain, and could not wet one mound."</p>
<p>"What you have said," his friend replied, "I know is very true;</p>
<p>But I'm resolved to do my best, and more I cannot do.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>I'll try to cheer his heart a bit: so now I'm off&mdash;here goes!"</p>
<p>And down the little rain-drop fell upon the farmer's nose.</p>
<p>"Whatever's that?" the farmer cried. "Was it a drop of rain?</p>
<p>I do believe it's come at last; I have not watched in vain."</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>Now, when the second rain-drop saw his willing friend depart,</p>
<p>Said he, "I'll go as well, and try to cheer the farmer's heart."</p>
<p>But many rain-drops by this time had been attracted out,</p>
<p>To see and hear what their two friends were talking so about.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>"We'll go as well," a number cried, "as our two friends have gone.</p>
<p>We shall not only cheer his heart, but water, too, his corn.</p>
<p>We're off! we're off!" they shout with glee, and down they fell so fast.</p>
<p>"O bless the Lord!" the farmer cried, "the rain has come at last."</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>The corn it grew and ripened well, and into food was dressed,</p>
<p>Because a little rain-drop said, "I'll try, and do my best."</p>
<p>This little lesson, children dear, you'll not forget I'm sure;</p>
<p>Try, do your best, do what you can&mdash;angels can do no more.</p>

<h2>THE SCOLDING OLD DAME.</h2>


<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<div class="figleft3">
T</div> <br style="line-height: 30%" />
<p class="i2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>HERE</b> once was a toper&mdash;I'll not tell his name&mdash;</p>
<p class="i4">Who had for his comfort a scolding old dame;</p>
<p>And often and often he wished himself dead,</p>
<p>For, if drunk he came home, she would beat him to bed.</p>
<p>He spent all his evenings away from his home,</p>
<p>And, when he returned, he would sneakingly come</p>
<p>And try to walk straightly, and say not a word&mdash;</p>
<p>Just to keep his dear wife from abusing her lord;</p>
<p>For if he dared say his tongue was his own,</p>
<p>'Twould set her tongue going, in no gentle tone,</p>
<p>And she'd huff him, and cuff him, and call him hard names,</p>
<p>And he'd sigh to be rid of all scolding old dames.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>It happened, one night, on a frolic he went,</p>
<p>He stayed till his very last penny was spent;</p>
<p>But how to go home, and get safely to bed,</p>
<p>Was the thing on his heart that most heavily weighed.</p>
<p>But home he must go; so he caught up his hat,</p>
<p>And off he went singing, by this and by that,</p>
<p>"I'll pluck up my courage; I guess she's in bed.</p>
<p>If she a'nt, 'tis no matter, I'm sure. Who's afraid?"</p>
<p>He came to his door; he lingered until</p>
<p>He peeped, and he listened, and all seemed quite still,</p>
<p>In he went, and his wife, sure enough, was in bed!</p>
<p>"Oh!" says he, "it's just as I thought. Who's afraid?"</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>He crept about softly, and spoke not a word;</p>
<p>His wife seemed to sleep, for she never e'en stirred!</p>
<p>Thought he, "For <i>this</i> night, then, my fortune is made:</p>
<p>For my dear, scolding wife is asleep! Who's afraid?"</p>
<p>But soon he felt thirsty; and slyly he rose,</p>
<p>And, groping around, to the table he goes,</p>
<p>The pitcher found empty, and so was the bowl,</p>
<p>The pail, and the tumblers&mdash;she'd emptied the whole!</p>
<p>At length, in a corner, a vessel he found!</p>
<p>Says he, "Here's something to drink, I'll be bound!"</p>
<p>And eagerly seizing, he lifted it up&mdash;</p>
<p>And drank it all off in one long, hearty sup!</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page175" id="page175"></a>[page&nbsp;175]</span>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>It tasted so queerly; and what could it be?</p>
<p>He wondered. It neither was water nor tea!</p>
<p>Just then a thought struck him and filled him with fear:</p>
<p>"Oh! it must be the poison for rats, I declare!"</p>
<p>And loudly he called on his dear, sleeping wife,</p>
<p>And begged her to rise; "for," said he, "on my life</p>
<p>I fear it was <i>poison</i> the bowl did contain.</p>
<p><i>Oh dear! yes</i>, it <i>was</i> poison; I now feel the pain!"</p>
<p>"And what made you dry, sir?" the wife sharply cried.</p>
<p>"'Twould serve you just right if from poison you died;</p>
<p>And you've done a <i>fine</i> job, and you'd now better march,</p>
<p><i>For just see, you brute, you have drunk all my starch!</i>"</p>

 Dr. Redman, of New York, was a noted medium, and it
was said that, for a while, wherever he might be, bones would
be dropped all about him, to the confusion and wonder of
everybody. These bones, he said, were brought him by a
spirit, whose bones were of no further use to him.</p>

<p><i>Hetty.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;O, such a fright!</p>

<p><i>Fanny.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Such a stupid!</p>

<p><i>Lizzie.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;I never saw such a ridiculous figure in the
whole course of my life!</p>

<p><i>Hetty.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;I should think she came from the back-woods.</p>

<p><i>Fanny.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Who is she, any way?</p>

<p><i>Lizzie.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;She's the daughter of the rich Mr. Jones,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page181" id="page181"></a>[page&nbsp;181]</span>
a man, who, three years ago, was the proprietor of a
very small saw-mill away down east. He managed
to scrape together a little money, which he invested
in certain railroad stocks, which nobody thought
would ever pay. They did, however, and he has, no
doubt to his own astonishment, made a great deal of
money.</p>

<p><i>Hetty.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;And that accounts for Miss Precise's partiality.
Well, I'm not going to associate myself with
her; and I mean to write to father this very day,
and tell him to take me home. She dresses so
ridiculously!</p>

<p><i>Lizzie.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;And talks so horridly!</p>

<p><i>Fanny.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;And plays so wretchedly!</p>

<p><i>Hetty.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;O, girls, don't you think I caught her at
the piano this morning playing Yankee Doodle and
whistling an accompaniment!</p>

<p><i>Fanny.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Whistling!</p>

<p><i>Lizzie.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Good gracious! what would Miss Precise
say. If there's anything she forbids, it's whistling.</p>

<p><i>Hetty.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, and such a reader! I heard her
reciting Longfellow's Excelsior; and such reading,
and such gestures! &nbsp;&nbsp;(<i>Recites.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Fanny.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;O, it's ridiculous!</p>

<p><i>Lizzie.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;And then her dress! O, girls, I've made
a discovery!</p>

<p><i>Fanny.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;What is it? What is it?</p>

<p><i>Hetty.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;O, do tell us!</p>

<p><i>Lizzie.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Well, then, you must be secret.</p>

<p><i>Fanny and Hetty.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, of course!</p>

<p><i>Lizzie.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Well, yesterday, at just twelve o'clock, I
was in the hall; the door-bell rang; I opened it;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page182" id="page182"></a>[page&nbsp;182]</span>
there was a box for Miss Hannah Jones; I took it;
I carried it to her room; I opened&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Fanny and Hetty.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;The box?</p>

<p><i>Lizzie.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;The door; she wasn't there. I put it on
the table; it slipped off; the cover rolled off; and
such a sight!</p>

<p><i>Fanny.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;What was it?</p>

<p><i>Hetty.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;O, do tell us!</p>

<p><i>Lizzie.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Four&mdash;great&mdash;red&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Fanny and Hetty.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;What? What?</p>

<p><i>Lizzie.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Chignons!</p>

<p><i>Hetty.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Chignons? Why, Miss Precise has forbidden
our wearing them.</p>

<p><i>Fanny.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;O, it's horrible!</p>

<p><i>Lizzie.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Ain't it? And I did want one so bad!</p>

<p><i>Hetty.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;But she cannot wear them.</p>

<p><i>Lizzie.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;We shall see! Now comes Miss Precise's
trial. She has taken Hannah Jones because her
father is rich. She worships money; but if there is
anything she hates, it is chignons. If she can stand
this test, it will be the best thing in the world for us.
Then we'll all have them.</p>

<p><i>Hetty.</i>&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course we will.</p>

<p><i>Fanny.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;But I don't like the idea of having such
an interloper here. She's no company for us.</p>

the barbarians!</p>

<p><i>Miss Precise.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;And pray, whom are you consigning
to a place among the barbarians, young ladies?</p>

your dread anathema been bestowed?</p>

<p><i>Lizzie.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Well, Miss Precise, if I must tell, it's that
hateful new pupil, Miss Jones. I detest her.</p>

<p><i>Fanny.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;I can't abide her.</p>

<p><i>Hetty.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;She's horrible!</p>

<p><i>Lizzie.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;So awkward!</p>

<p><i>Hetty.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Nor I.</p>

<p><i>Miss P.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Young ladies, are you pupils of the finest

<p><i>Lizzie.</i>&nbsp;&nbsp; Don't know. S'pose so.</p>

<p><i>Miss P.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;S'pose so! What language! S'pose
so! Is this the fruit of my teaching? Young ladies,
I blush for you!&mdash;you, who should be the patterns of
propriety! Let me hear no more of this. Miss
Jones is the daughter of one of the richest men in
the city, and, as such, she should be respected by
you.</p>

<p><i>Lizzie.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;She's a low, ignorant girl.</p>

<p><i>Miss P.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Miss Bond!</p>

<p><i>Hetty.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;With arms like a windmill.</p>

<p><i>Miss P.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Miss Gray!</p>

<p><i>Hetty, Lizzie, and Fanny.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;O, she's awful!</p>

<p><i>Miss P.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Young ladies! I'm astonished! I'm
shocked! I'm thunderstruck! Miss Jones is my
pupil. She is your associate. As such, you will
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page184" id="page184"></a>[page&nbsp;184]</span>
respect her. Let me hear no more of this. Go to
your studies. I highly respect Miss Jones. Imitate
her. She's not given to conspiracies. She's not
forever gossiping. Be like her, and you will deserve
my respect. To your studies. Miss Jones is a

got the hang of rich folks yit. That's why I'm here
to git polished up. Miss Precise is the schoolmarm,

me. I do hate airs. She makes the girls tend tu

<p><i>Mrs. L.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;I devote one day in the week to visiting
poor people, and doing what I can to alleviate their
misfortunes.</p>

<p><i>Hannah.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Well, marm, that's real clever in you.
I do like to see rich folks look arter the poor ones.
Won't you please to let me help you? I don't
know the way among the poor yit, but I'm going

<p><i>Mrs. L.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;O, thank you, thank you! you are very
kind; I will use it, for I know just where it is needed.
Can you really spare it?</p>

<p><i>Hannah.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Spare it? Of course I can. I know
where to git lots more; and my pa says, 'What's
the use of having money, if you don't do good with
it?' Law, I forgot all about Miss Precise. You just
make yourself to home, and I'll call her. [<i>Exit</i>, <span class="sc">l.</span></p>

<p><i>Fanny.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;And so do I.</p>

<p><i>Miss P.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;First tell me what is the meaning of this
scene we have just had.</p>

<p><i>Lizzie.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Scene? Why, didn't you tell us to take
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page190" id="page190"></a>[page&nbsp;190]</span>
Miss Jones as a model for imitation? Haven't we
done it?</p>

<p><i>Miss P.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;But Miss Jones doesn't whistle.</p>

<p><i>Hannah.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Whistle? I bet I can. Want to hear
me?</p>

<p><i>Miss P.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;No. She don't sing comic songs.</p>

<p><i>Hannah.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, she does.</p>

<p><i>Lizzie.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, and she wears chignons. As we
must imitate her, and hadn't any of our own, we
appropriated hers.</p>

<p><i>Miss P.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Shame, shame! What will Mrs. Lofty
say?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. L.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;That she rather enjoyed it. I saw mischief
in their eyes as they came in. And now,
girls, I'm going to tell you what Miss Jones does
that you <i>don't</i> know. A short time ago she placed
in my hands her pocket-book, containing a large roll
of bills, to be distributed among the poor.</p>

<p><i>Lizzie.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Why, isn't she splendid?</p>

<p><i>Hetty.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Why, she's "mag."</p>

<p><i>Fanny.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;O, you dear old Hannah. &nbsp;&nbsp;(<i>Kisses her.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Mrs. L.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;I'm going to send my daughter here to
school, and I shall tell her to make all the friends
she can; but her first friend must be Hannah Jones.</p>

<p><i>Hannah.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I'm sure, I'm obleeged to you.</p>

<p><i>Lizzie.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;O, Miss Precise, we are so sorry we
have acted so! Let us try again, and show Mrs.
Lofty that we have benefited by your instruction.</p>

<p><i>Miss P.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Not now. If Mrs. Lofty will call again,
we will try to entertain her. I see I was in the
wrong to give you such general directions. I say
now, imitate Hannah Jones&mdash;her warm heart, her
generous hand.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. L.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;And help her, by your friendship, to
acquire the knowledge which Miss Precise so ably
dispenses.</p>

<p><i>Lizzie.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;We will, we will.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page191" id="page191"></a>[page&nbsp;191]</span>
<p><i>Miss P.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Only, ladies, avoid whistling.</p>

<p><i>Hetty.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, of course.</p>

<p><i>Miss P.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;And comic songs!</p>

<p><i>Fanny.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;O, certainly.</p>

<p><i>Lizzie.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;And there is one more thing we shall be
sure to avoid.</p>

<p><i>Miss P.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;What is that?</p>

<p><i>Lizzie.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;The wearing of red chignons.</p>

<h2>A HORSE-CAR INCIDENT.</h2>

<p style="line-height: 1%; margin-top: -0.5em;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="dropcap" ><span class="dcap">N</span>
<b>O</b> matter what horse-car, but it happened that
I had to go a mile or two, and held up my
cane to attract the attention of the driver or the conductor
of one of them, which I did, after some
difficulty. I am bound to say it was not on the
Touchandgo road, for the officers employed there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page195" id="page195"></a>[page&nbsp;195]</span>
have an instinctive knowledge whether a man wishes
to ride or not, and indeed often by the magic of the
upraised finger they draw people in to ride who had
hardly any previous intention of it. I have been
attracted in this way, and found myself to my
astonishment, seated in the car, confident that I had
signified no disposition to do so. In this instance,
however, I would ride, and got in.</p>

<p>There were the usual passengers in the car&mdash;the
respectable people going out of town, who were
reading the last editions of the papers, the women
who had been shopping, the servant girls who had
been in to visit their friends, feeling no interest in
one another, and all absorbed in their own reflections,
as I was. I was thinking seriously, when&mdash;my
eye was attracted by some glittering object on the
floor, beneath the opposite seat.</p>

<p>Of course everybody is attracted by glitter. A
piece of glass in the moonlight may be a diamond,
and show is far ahead of substance in influencing
men, from the illusion which affects short-sighted
vision. Thus this glittering object. What was it?&mdash;a
diamond pin dropped by a former passenger?
No, it could not be this, because it appeared to be
round, and bigger than a pin stone could be. Could
it be a bracelet? No, for it was too small. I
directed my gaze more earnestly towards it in my
doubt, and saw that it was a <span class="sc">QUARTER</span>, bright and
sparkling with the freshness of new mint about it, so
it seemed.</p>

<p>This I determined to make mine at the first chance,
for a woman was sitting very near it, and I dreaded
any confusion I might cause, by a sudden plunge,
through the motion of the cars; so, whistling at a
low breath, as if indifferent, but keeping my eye
upon the prize, I awaited the opportunity that should
insure me the coveted one-and-sixpence. It soon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page196" id="page196"></a>[page&nbsp;196]</span>
came: the bell rang, and the lady opposite, with
her arms full of bundles, walked out, leaving the
object of my ardent regard more distinctly in view.
It seemed to me that every one in the car had an
eye on that quarter, which I felt was mine by right
of discovery, and which I was determined to have.</p>

<p>As the coach started I rose and fairly tumbled over
into the just-vacated seat, taking care to drop in such
a way as to screen the glittering bait. I looked at
my fellow-passengers, and found that all were staring
at me, as though they were reading my secret. The
conductor had come inside the door, and was looking
at me, and a heavy gentleman on the same seat
with me leaned far out on his cane, so that he could
take in my whole person with his glance, as though
I were a piece of property on which he had to estimate.
I felt my face burn, and a general discomfort
seized me, as a man sometimes feels when he has
done a wrong or a foolish act; though I couldn't
think the act I was about to perform was wrong,
and no one could say it was foolish in one to try
to get a quarter of a dollar in this day of postal
currency. At length I stooped down as if to adjust
something about my boot, and slipped the object of
my solicitude into my hand, unseen, as I believed.</p>

<p>"What is it?" asked the conductor.</p>

<p>"What's what?" said I, with affected smartness.</p>

<p>"What you just found," he persisted.</p>

<p>"I was pulling my pants down over my boot," I
prevaricated.</p>

<p>"That's all humbug," said he; "you found something
in the car, and it belongs to the company."</p>

<p>"Prove that I found any thing," said I, angrily.</p>

<p>"Young man," said the voice of the big man who
was leaning on his cane, still looking at me, "it
is as bad to lie about a thing as it is to steal. I
saw you pick something up, and to me it had the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page197" id="page197"></a>[page&nbsp;197]</span>
appearance of money." He struck his cane on the
floor as he spoke, and grasped it firmer, as if to
clinch his remark.</p>

<p>"Yes," said the conductor; "and we don't want
nothing of the kind here, and what's more, we won't
have it; so hand over."</p>

<p>"My fine fellow," said I, prepared for a crisis,
"I know my rights, and, without admitting that I
have found any thing, I contend that if I had, in
this public conveyance, which is as public as the
street to him who pays for a ride in it, that which
I find in it is mine after I have made due endeavour
to find out its owner. Money being an article impossible
to identify, unless it is marked, if I had
found it, it would have been mine&mdash;according to
Whately, Lycurgus, and Jew Moses."</p>

<p>"Hang your authorities," said he; "I don't know
any thing about 'em, but this I know,&mdash;that money
belongs to the Touchandgo Horse Railroad Company,
and I'll have it. Ain't I right, Mr. Diggs?"
addressing a gentleman with glasses on, reading the
Journal.</p>

<p>"I think you are," replied he, looking at me over
the top of his spectacles, as though he were shooting
from behind a breastwork; "I think the pint is
clear, and that it belongs to the company to advertise
it and find out the owner."</p>

<p>"Well," I put in, "suppose they don't find the
owner; who has it?"</p>

<p>"The company, I should think," said he, folding
his paper preparatory to getting out.</p>

<p>"That's it," said the conductor, taking up the
thread as he put the passenger down; "and now I
want that money." He looked ugly.</p>

<p>"What money?" I queried.</p>

<p>"The money you picked up on the floor."</p>

<p>I saw that I was in a place of considerable difficulty,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page198" id="page198"></a>[page&nbsp;198]</span>
involving a row on one side and imputation of
villany on the other, and studied how to escape.</p>

<p>"Well," said I, "if, in spite of the authorities I
have quoted, you insist upon my giving this up which
I hold in my hand,&mdash;the value of which I do not
know,&mdash;I shall protest against your act, and hold the
company responsible."</p>

<p>"Responsible be&mdash;&mdash;blowed," replied he, severely;
"shell out."</p>

<p>The people in the car were much excited. The fat
man on the seat had risen up, though still in sitting
position, and balanced himself upon his toes to get a
better view. I unclosed my hand and deposited in
the conductor's a round piece of tin that had been
punched out by some tin-man and hammered smooth
bearing a close resemblance to money!</p>

<p>The disappointment of every one was intense. The
conductor intimated that if he met me in society he
would give me my money's worth, the fat man muttered
something about my being an "imposture,"
several lady passengers looked bluely at me, and
only one laughed heartily at the whole affair, as I
did. It was a queer incident.</p>

<p>When, one morning, to Xantippe, Socrates said,</p>
<p>"I think, for a man of my standing in life,</p>
<p>This house is too small, as I now have a wife:</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page199" id="page199"></a>[page&nbsp;199]</span>

<p>Shall be sent for to widen my house and my dairy."</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>"Now, Socrates, dearest," Xantippe replied,</p>

<h2>PAUL REVERE'S RIDE.</h2>

L</div> <br style="line-height: 30%" />
<p class="i2">&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>ISTEN</b>, my children, and you shall hear</p>
<p class="i6">Of the midnight ride of Paul Revere,</p>
<p>On the eighteenth of April, in Seventy-Five:</p>
<p>Hardly a man is now alive</p>
<p>Who remembers that famous day and year.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>He said to his friend&mdash;"If the British march</p>
<p>By land or sea from the town to-night,</p>
<p>Hang a lantern aloft in the belfry arch</p>
<p>Of the North-Church tower, as a signal-light&mdash;</p>
<p>One if by land, and two if by sea;</p>
<p>And I on the opposite shore will be,</p>
<p>Ready to ride and spread the alarm</p>
<p>Through every Middlesex village and farm,</p>
<p>For the country-folk to be up and to arm."</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>Then he said good-night, and with muffled oar</p>
<p>Silently rowed to the Charlestown shore,</p>
<p>Just as the moon rose over the bay,</p>
<p>Where swinging wide at her moorings lay</p>
<p>The Somerset, British man-of-war:</p>
<p>A phantom ship, with each mast and spar</p>
<p>Across the moon, like a prison-bar,</p>
<p>And a huge, black hulk, that was magnified</p>
<p>By its own reflection in the tide.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>Meanwhile, his friend, through alley and street</p>
<p>Wanders and watches with eager ears,</p>
<p>Till in the silence around him he hears</p>
<p>The muster of men at the barrack-door,</p>
<p>The sound of arms and the tramp of feet,</p>
<p>And the measured tread of the grenadiers</p>
<p>Marching down to their boats on the shore.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>Then he climbed to the tower of the church,</p>
<p>Up the wooden stairs, with stealthy tread,</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page201" id="page201"></a>[page&nbsp;201]</span>
<p>To the belfry-chamber overhead,</p>
<p>And startled the pigeons from their perch</p>
<p>On the sombre rafters, that round him made</p>
<p>Masses and moving shapes of shade&mdash;</p>
<p>Up the light ladder, slender and tall,</p>
<p>To the highest window in the wall,</p>
<p>Where he paused to listen and look down</p>
<p>A moment on the roofs of the quiet town,</p>
<p>And the moonlight flowing over all.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>Beneath, in the church-yard, lay the dead</p>
<p>In their night-encampment on the hill,</p>
<p>Wrapped in silence so deep and still,</p>
<p>That he could hear, like a sentinel's tread</p>
<p>The watchful night-wind as it went</p>
<p>Creeping along from tent to tent,</p>
<p>And seeming to whisper, "All is well!"</p>
<p>A moment only he feels the spell</p>
<p>Of the place and the hour, the secret dread</p>
<p>Of the lonely belfry and the dead;</p>
<p>For suddenly all his thoughts are bent</p>
<p>On a shadowy something far away,</p>
<p>Where the river widens to meet the bay&mdash;</p>
<p>A line of black, that bends and floats</p>
<p>On the rising tide, like a bridge of boats.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>Meanwhile, impatient to mount and ride,</p>
<p>Booted and spurred, with a heavy stride,</p>
<p>On the opposite shore waited Paul Revere.</p>
<p>Now he patted his horse's side,</p>
<p>Now gazed on the landscape far and near,</p>
<p>Then impetuous stamped the earth,</p>
<p>And turned and tightened his saddle-girth;</p>
<p>But mostly he watched with eager search</p>
<p>The belfry-tower of the old North-Church,</p>
<p>As it rose above the graves on the hill,</p>
<p>Lonely, and spectral, and sombre, and still.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">

<p>A glimmer, and then a gleam of light!</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page202" id="page202"></a>[page&nbsp;202]</span>
<p>He springs to the saddle, the bridle he turns,</p>
<p>But lingers and gazes, till full on his sight</p>
<p>A second lamp in the belfry burns!</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>A hurry of hoofs in a village-street,</p>
<p>A shape in the moonlight, a bulk in the dark,</p>
<p>And beneath from the pebbles, in passing, a spark</p>
<p>Struck out by a steed that flies fearless and fleet:</p>
<p>That was all! And yet, through the gloom and the light,</p>
<p>The fate of a nation was riding that night;</p>
<p>And the spark struck out by that steed, in his flight,</p>
<p>Kindled the land into flame with its heat.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>It was twelve by the village-clock,</p>
<p>When he crossed the bridge into Medford town,</p>
<p>He heard the crowing of the cock,</p>

<p>And felt the damp of the river-fog,</p>
<p>That rises when the sun goes down.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>It was one by the village-clock,</p>

<p>As if they already stood aghast</p>
<p>At the bloody work they would look upon.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>It was two by the village-clock,</p>

<h2>A PLEASURE EXERTION.</h2>

<p class="indright"><b>MARIETTA HOLLEY.</b></p>

<p class="dropcap" ><span class="dcap">T</span>
<b>HEY</b> have been havin' pleasure exertions all summer
here to Jonesville. Every week a'most they
would go off on a exertion after pleasure, and Josiah
was all up in end to go too.</p>

<p>That man is a well-principled man as I ever see;
but if he had his head he would be worse than any
young man I ever see to foller up pic-nics, and 4th of
Julys, and camp meetin's, and all pleasure exertions.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page204" id="page204"></a>[page&nbsp;204]</span>
But I don't encourage him in it. I have said to
him, time and agin, "There is a time for everything,
Josiah Allen, and after anybody has lost all their
teeth, and every mite of hair on the top of their head,
it is time for 'em to stop goin' to pleasure exertions."</p>

<p>But, good land! I might jest as well talk to the
wind. If that man should get to be as old as Mr.
Methusler, and be a goin' a thousand years old, he
would prick up his ears if he should hear of an
exertion. All summer long that man has beset me
to go to 'em, for he wouldn't go without me. Old
Bunker Hill himself hain't any sounder in principle
than Josiah Allen, and I have had to work head-work
to make excuses, and quell him down. But, last
week, the old folks was goin' to have one out on the
lake, on an island, and that man sot his foot down
that go he would.</p>

<p>We was to the breakfast-table, a talkin' it over,
and says I, "I shan't go, for I am afraid of big
water any way."</p>

<p>Says Josiah, "You are jest as liable to be killed in
one place as another."</p>

<p>Says I, with a almost frigid air, as I passed him
his coffee, "Mebby I shall be drownded on dry land,
Josiah Allen; but I don't believe it."</p>

<p>Says he, in a complainin' tone, "I can't get you
started onto a exertion for pleasure any way."</p>

<p>Says I, in a almost eloquent way, "I don't believe
in makin' such exertions after pleasure. I don't
believe in chasin' of her up." Says I, "Let her come
of her own free will." Says I, "You can't catch her
by chasin' of her up, no more than you can fetch a
shower up, in a drewth, by goin' out doors, and running
after a cloud up in the heavens above you. Sit
down, and be patient; and when it gets ready, the
refreshin' rain-drops will begin to fall without none of
your help. And it is jest so with pleasure, Josiah
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page205" id="page205"></a>[page&nbsp;205]</span>
Allen; you may chase her up over all the ocians
and big mountains of the earth, and she will keep
ahead of you all the time; but set down, and not
fatigue yourself a thinkin' about her, and like as
not she will come right into your house, unbeknown
to you."</p>

<p>"Wal," says he, "I guess I'll have another griddlecake,
Samantha." And as he took it, and poured
the maple syrup over it, he added, gently but firmly,
"I shall go, Samantha, to this exertion, and I
should be glad to have you present at it, because
it seems jest, to me, as if I should fall overboard
durin' the day."</p>

<p>Men are deep. Now that man knew that no
amount of religious preachin' could stir me up like
that one speech. For though I hain't no hand to
coo, and don't encourage him in bein' spoony at all,
he knows that I am wrapped almost completely up in
him. I went.</p>

<p>We had got to start about the middle of the night,
for the lake was fifteen miles from Jonesville, and the
old horse bein' so slow, we had got to start a hour or
two ahead of the rest. I told Josiah that I had jest
as lives set up all night, as to be routed out at two
o'clock. But he was so animated and happy at the
idee of goin' that he looked on the bright side of
everything, and he said that we would go to bed before
dark, and get as much sleep as we commonly
did! So we went to bed, the sun an hour high. But
we hadn't more'n got settled down into the bed, when
we heard a buggy and a single wagon stop to the
gate, and I got up and peeked through the window,
and I see it was visitors come to spend the evenin'&mdash;Elder
Wesley Minkly and his family, and Deacon
Dobbins' folks. Josiah vowed that he wouldn't stir
one step out of that bed that night. But I argued
with him pretty sharp, while I was throwin' on my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page206" id="page206"></a>[page&nbsp;206]</span>
clothes, and I finally got him started up. I hain't
deceitful, but I thought, if I got my clothes all on
before they came in, I wouldn't tell 'em that I had
been to bed that time of day. And I did get all
dressed up, even to my handkerchief pin. And I
guess they had been there as much as ten minutes
before I thought that I hadn't took my night-cap off.
They looked dretful curious at me, and I felt awful
meachin'. But I jest ketched it off, and never said
nothin'. But when Josiah came out of the bedroom,
with what little hair he has got standin' out in every
direction, no two hairs a layin' the same way, I up
and told 'em. I thought mebby they wouldn't stay
long. But Deacon Dobbins' folks seemed to be all
waked up on the subject of religion, and they proposed
we should turn it into a kind of a conference
meetin'; so they never went home till after ten
o'clock.</p>

<p>It was most eleven o'clock when Josiah and me
got to bed agin. And then jest as I was gettin' into
a drowse, I heard the cat in the buttery, and I got up
to let her out. And that rousted Josiah up, and he
thought he heard the cattle in the garden, and he got
up and went out. And there we was a marchin'
round most all night. And if we would get into a
nap, Josiah would think it was mornin', and he
would start up and go out to look at the clock. I
lost myself once, for I dreampt that Josiah was a
droundin', and Deacon Dobbins was on the shore a
prayin' for him. It started me so, that I jest ketched
hold of Josiah and hollered. It skairt him awfully,
and says he, "What does ail you, Samantha? I
hain't been asleep before to-night, and now you have
rousted me up for good. I wonder what time it is?"
And then he got out of bed again, and went out and
looked at the clock. It was half-past one, and he
said "he didn't believe we had better go to sleep
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page207" id="page207"></a>[page&nbsp;207]</span>
again for fear we would be too late for the exertion,
and he wouldn't miss that for nothin'."</p>

<p>"Exertion," says I, in a awful cold tone; "I
should think we had had exertion enough for one
spell."</p>

<p>But I got up at 2 o'clock, and made a cup of tea
as strong as I could, for we both felt beat out, worse
than if we had watched in sickness.</p>

<p>But, as bad and wore out as Josiah felt bodily, he
was all animated in his mind about what a good time
he was a goin' to have. He acted foolish, and I told
him so. I wanted to wear my brown and black
gingham, and a shaker; but Josiah insisted that I
should wear a new lawn dress that he had brought
me home as a present, and I had got just made up.
So, jest to please him, I put it on, and my best
bonnet. And that man, all I could do and say,
would wear a pair of pantaloons I had been a makin'
for Thomas Jefferson. They was gettin' up a military
company in Thomas J.'s school, and these pantaloons
was white with a blue stripe down the sides, a
kind of uniform. Josiah took a awful fancy to 'em;
and, says he,</p>

<p>"I will wear 'em, Samantha; they look so dressy."</p>

<p>Says I, "They hain't hardly done. I was goin' to
stitch that blue stripe on the left leg on again. They
haint finished as they ought to be, and I would not
wear 'em. It looks vain in you."</p>

<p>Says he, "I will wear 'em, Samantha. I will be
dressed up for once."</p>

<p>I didn't contend with him. Thinks I, we are
makin' fools of ourselves by goin' at all, and if he
wants to make a little bigger fool of himself, I won't
stand in his light. And then I had got some
machine oil onto 'em, so I felt that I had got to
wash 'em any way, before Thomas J. took 'em to
school. So he put 'em on.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page208" id="page208"></a>[page&nbsp;208]</span>

<p>I had good vittles, and a sight of 'em. The basket
wouldn't hold 'em all. So Josiah had to put a bottle
of red rhaspberry jell into the pocket of his dress
coat, and lots of other little things, such as spoons,
and knives, and forks, in his pantaloons and breast
pockets. He looked like Captain Kidd, armed up to
the teeth, and I told him so. But, good land, he
would have carried a knife in his mouth if I had
asked him, he felt so neat about goin', and boasted
so, on what a splendid exertion it was going to be.</p>

<p>We got to the lake about eight o'clock, being
about the first ones there; but they kep' a comin',
and before 10 o'clock we all got there. There was
about 20 old fools of us, when we got all collected
together. And about 10 o'clock we sot sail for the
island. Josiah havin' felt so animated and tickled
about the exertion, was worked up awfully when,
just after we had got well out onto the lake, the wind
took his hat off and blew it away. He had made up
his mind to look so pretty that day, and be so dressed
up, that it worked him up awfully. And then the
sun beat down onto him: and if he had had any hair
onto his head it would have seemed more shady.
But I did the best I could by him; I stood by him,
and pinned on his red bandanna handkerchief onto
his head. But as I was a fixin' it on, I see there was
something more than mortification that ailed him.
The lake was rough, and the boat rocked, and I see
he was beginning to be awful sick. He looked deathly.
Pretty soon I felt bad too. Oh, the wretchedness
of that time! I have enjoyed poor health considerable
in my life, but never did I enjoy so much
sickness, in so short a time, as I did on that pleasure
exertion to the island. I suppose our bein' up all
night a'most made it worse. When we reached the
island we was both weak as cats.</p>

<p>I set right down on a stun, and held my head for a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page209" id="page209"></a>[page&nbsp;209]</span>
spell, for it did seem as if it would split open. After
awhile I staggered up onto my feet, and finally I got
so I could walk straight, and sense things a little.
Then I began to take the things out of my dinner
basket. The butter had all melted, so we had to dip
it out with a spoon. And a lot of water had swashed
over the side of the boat, so my pies, and tarts, and
delicate cake, and cookies, looked awful mixed up,
but no worse than the rest of the company's did. But
we did the best we could, and begun to make preparations
to eat, for the man that owned the boat
said he knew it would rain before night, by the way
the sun scalded. There wasn't a man or a woman
there but what the perspiration jest poured down
their faces. We was a haggered and melancholy
lookin' set. There was a piece of woods a little ways
off, but it was up quite a rise of ground, and there
wasn't one of us but what had the rheumatiz, more
or less. We made up a fire on the sand, though it
seemed as if it was hot enough to steep the tea and
coffee as it was.</p>

<p>After we got the fire started, I histed a umberell,
and sat down under it, and fanned myself hard, for I
was afraid of a sunstroke.</p>

<p>Wal, I guess I had sat there ten minutes or more,
when all of a sudden I thought, Where is Josiah? I
hadn't seen him since we had got there. I riz right
up and asked the company, almost wildly, "If they
had seen my companion, Josiah?" They said "No,
they hadn't." But Celestine Wilkins' little girl, who
had come with her grandpa and grandma Gowdey,
spoke up, and says she, "I seen him a goin' off
towards the woods; he acted dreadfully strange, too,
he seemed to be a walkin' off sideways."</p>

<p>"Had the sufferin's we had undergone made him
delirious?" says I to myself; and then I started off
on the run towards the woods, and old Miss Bobbet,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page210" id="page210"></a>[page&nbsp;210]</span>
and Miss Gowdey, and Sister Minkley, and Deacon
Dobbins' wife, all rushed after me. Oh, the agony
of them 2 or 3 minutes, my mind so distracted with
forebodin's, and the perspiration a pourin' down.
But, all of a sudden, on the edge of the woods we
found him. Miss Gowdey weighed 100 pounds less
than me; had got a little ahead of me. He sat
backed up against a tree in a awful cramped position,
with his left leg under him. He looked dretful
uncomfortable, but when Miss Gowdey hollered out:
"Oh, here you be; we have been skairt about you;
what is the matter?" he smiled a dretful sick smile,
and says he: "Oh, I thought I would come out here
and meditate a spell. It was always a real treat to
me to meditate."</p>

<p>Jest then I came up, a pantin' for breath, and as
the women all turned to face me, Josiah scowled at
me, and shook his fist at them 4 wimmen, and made
the most mysterious motions with his hands towards
'em. But the minute they turned 'round he smiled
in a sickish way, and pretended to go to whistlin'.</p>

<p>Says I, "What is the matter, Josiah Allen? What
are you off here for?"</p>

<p>"I am a meditatin', Samantha."</p>

<p>The wimmen happened to be a lookin' the other
way for a minute, and he looked at me as if he would
take my head off, and made the strangest motions
towards 'em; but the minute they looked at him he
would pretend to smile that deathly smile.</p>

<p>Says I, "Come, Josiah Allen, we're goin' to have
dinner right away, for we are afraid it will rain."</p>

<p>"Oh, wal," says he, "a little rain, more or less,
hain't a goin' to hinder a man from meditatin'."</p>

<p>I was wore out, and says I: "Do you stop meditatin'
this minute, Josiah Allen."</p>

<p>Says he: "I won't stop, Samantha. I let you
have your way a good deal of the time; but when I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page211" id="page211"></a>[page&nbsp;211]</span>
take it into my head to meditate, you hain't a goin'
to break it up."</p>

<p>Says I: "Josiah Allen, come to dinner."</p>

<p>"Oh, I hain't hungry," says he. "The table will
probably be full. I had jest as leves wait."</p>

<p>"Table full!" says I. "You know jest as well as
I do that we are eatin' on the ground. Do you come
and eat your dinner this minute."</p>

<p>"Yes, do come," says Miss Bobbet.</p>

<p>"Oh," says he, with that ghastly smile, a pretendin'
to joke; "I have got plenty to eat here, I can eat
muskeeters."</p>

<p>The air was black with 'em; I couldn't deny it.</p>

<p>"The muskeeters will eat you, more likely," says
I. "Look at your face and hands."</p>

<p>"Yes, they have eat considerable of a dinner out
of me, but I don't begrech 'em. I hain't small
enough, I hope, to begrech 'em one meal."</p>

<p>Miss Bobbet and the rest turned to go back, and
the minute we were alone he said:</p>

<p>"Can't you bring 40 or 50 more wimmen up here?
You couldn't come here a minute without a lot of
other wimmen tied to your heels!"</p>

<p>I began to see daylight, and then Josiah told me.</p>

<p>It seems he had set down on that bottle of rhaspberry
jell. That blue stripe on the side wasn't hardly
finished, as I said, and I hadn't fastened my thread
properly; so when he got to pullin' at 'em to try
to wipe off the jell, the thread started, and bein'
sewed on a machine, that seam jest ripped right open
from top to bottom. That was what he had walked
off sideways towards the woods for. Josiah Allen's
wife hain't one to desert a companion in distress. I
pinned 'em up as well as I could, and I didn't say
a word to hurt his feelin's, only I jest said this to
him, as I was a fixin' 'em: "Josiah Allen, is this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page212" id="page212"></a>[page&nbsp;212]</span>
pleasure?" Says I: "You was determined to
come."</p>

<p>"Throw that in my face again, will you? What if
I wuz? There goes a pin into my leg. I should
think I had suffered enough without your stabbin' of
me with pins."</p>

<p>"Wal, then, stand still, and not be a caperin'
round so. How do you suppose I can do anything
with you a tousin' round so?"</p>

<p>"Wal, don't be so agrevatin', then."</p>

<p>I fixed 'em as well as I could, but they looked
pretty bad, and then, there they was all covered with
jell, too. What to do I didn't know. But finally I
told him I would put my shawl onto him. So I
doubled it up corner-ways, as big as I could, so it
almost touched the ground behind, and he walked
back to the table with me. I told him it was best to
tell the company all about it, but he jest put his foot
down that he wouldn't, and I told him if he wouldn't
that he must make his own excuses to the company
about wearin' the shawl. So he told 'em that he
always loved to wear summer shawls; he thought it
made a man look so dressy.</p>

<p>But he looked as if he would sink all the time he
was a sayin' it. They all looked dretful curious at
him, and he looked as meachin' as if he had stole a
sheep, and he never took a minute's comfort, nor I
nuther. He was sick all the way back to the shore,
and so was I. And jest as we got into our wagons
and started for home, the rain begun to pour down.
The wind turned our old umberell inside out in no
time. My lawn dress was most spilte before, and
now I give up my bunnet. And I says to Josiah:</p>

<p>"This bunnet and dress are spilte, Josiah Allen,
and I shall have to buy some new ones."</p>

<p>"Wal! wal! who said you wouldn't?" he snapped
out.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page213" id="page213"></a>[page&nbsp;213]</span>

<p>But it wore on him. Oh, how the rain poured
down. Josiah havin' nothin' but his handkerchief
on his head felt it more than I did. I had took a
apron to put on a gettin' dinner, and I tried to make
him let me pin it on to his head. But says he,
firmly:</p>

<p>"I hain't proud and haughty, Samantha, but I
do feel above ridin' out with a pink apron on for a
hat."</p>

<p>"Wal, then," says I, "get as wet as sop if you
had ruther."</p>

<p>I didn't say no more, but there we jest sot and
suffered. The rain poured down, the wind howled
at us, the old horse went slow, the rheumatiz laid
holt of both of us, and the thought of the new bunnet
and dress was a wearin' on Josiah, I knew.</p>

<p>After I had beset him about the apron, we didn't
say hardly a word for as much as 13 miles or so;
but I did speak once, as he leaned forward with the
rain a drippin' offen his bandanna handkerchief onto
his white pantaloons. I says to him in stern tones:</p>

<p>"Is this pleasure, Josiah Allen?"</p>

<p>He gave the old mare a awful cut, and says he:
"I'd like to know what you want to be so agrevatin'
for?"</p>

<p>I didn't multiply any more words with him, only
as we drove up to our door-step, and he helped me
out into a mud puddle, I says to him:</p>

<p>"Mebby you'll hear to me another time, Josiah
Allen?"</p>

<p>And I'll bet he will. I hain't afraid to bet a ten-cent
bill that that man won't never open his mouth
to me again about a <span class="sc">Pleasure Exertion</span>.</p>

<p>By the hopes of the good, an' the cause of the brave,</p>
<p>That when he was mouldering in the cold grave</p>
<p>His enemies never should have it to boast</p>
<p>His scorn of their vengeance one moment was lost;</p>
<p>His bosom might bleed, but his cheek should be dhry,</p>
<p>For undaunted he lived, and undaunted he'd die.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page216" id="page216"></a>[page&nbsp;216]</span>
<p>Well, as soon as a few weeks was over and gone,</p>
<p>The terrible day iv the thrial kem on,</p>
<p>There was sich a crowd there was scarce room to stand,</p>
<p>An' sodgers on guard, an' dhragoons sword-in-hand;</p>
<p>An' the court-house so full that the people were bothered,</p>
<p>An' attorneys an' criers on the point iv bein' smothered;</p>
<p>An' counsellors almost gev over for dead,</p>
<p>An' the jury sittin' up in their box overhead;</p>
<p>An' the judge settled out so detarmined an' big,</p>
<p>With his gown on his back, and an illegant new wig;</p>
<p>An' silence was called, an' the minute it was said</p>
<p>The court was as still as the heart of the dead,</p>
<p>An' they heard but the openin' of one prison lock,</p>
<p>An' <span class="sc">Shamus O'Brien</span> kem into the dock.</p>
<p>For one minute he turned his eye round on the throng,</p>
<p>An' he looked at the bars, so firm and so strong,</p>
<p>An' he saw that he had not a hope nor a friend,</p>
<p>A chance to escape, nor a word to defend;</p>
<p>An' he folded his arms as he stood there alone,</p>
<p>As calm and as cold as a statue of stone;</p>
<p>And they read a big writin', a yard long at laste,</p>
<p>An' <span class="sc">Jim</span> didn't understand it, nor mind it a taste,</p>
<p>An' the judge took a big pinch iv snuff, and he says,</p>
<p>"Are you guilty or not, <span class="sc">Jim O'Brien</span>, av you plase?"</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>An' all held their breath in the silence of dhread,</p>
<p>An' <span class="sc">Shamus O'Brien</span> made answer and said:</p>
<p>"My lord, if you ask me, if in my life-time</p>
<p>I thought any treason, or did any crime</p>
<p>That should call to my cheek, as I stand alone here,</p>
<p>The hot blush of shame, or the coldness of fear,</p>
<p>Though I stood by the grave to receive my death-blow</p>
<p>Before <span class="sc">God</span> and the world I would answer you, no!</p>
<p>But if you would ask me, as I think it like,</p>
<p>If in the rebellion I carried a pike,</p>
<p>An' fought for ould Ireland from the first to the close,</p>
<p>An' shed the heart's blood of her bitterest foes,</p>
<p>I answer you, yes; and I tell you again,</p>
<p>Though I stand here to perish, it's my glory that then</p>
<p>In her cause I was willing my veins should run dhry,</p>
<p>An' that now for her sake I am ready to die."</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page217" id="page217"></a>[page&nbsp;217]</span>
<p>Then the silence was great, and the jury smiled bright,</p>
<p>An' the judge wasn't sorry the job was made light;</p>
<p>By my sowl, it's himself was the crabbed ould chap!</p>
<p>In a twinklin' he pulled on his ugly black cap.</p>
<p>Then <span class="sc">Shamus'</span> mother in the crowd standin' by,</p>
<p>Called out to the judge with a pitiful cry:</p>
<p>"O, judge! darlin', don't, O, don't say the word!</p>
<p>The crathur is young, have mercy, my lord;</p>
<p>He was foolish, he didn't know what he was doin';</p>
<p>You don't know him, my lord&mdash;O, don't give him to ruin!</p>
<p>He's the kindliest crathur, the tendherest-hearted;</p>
<p>Don't part us forever, we that's so long parted.</p>
<p>Judge, mavourneen, forgive him, forgive him, my lord,</p>
<p>An' <span class="sc">God</span> will forgive you&mdash;O, don't say the word!"</p>
<p>That was the first minute that <span class="sc">O'Brien</span> was shaken,</p>
<p>When he saw that he was not quite forgot or forsaken;</p>
<p>An' down his pale cheeks, at the word of his mother,</p>
<p>The big tears wor runnin' fast, one afther th' other;</p>
<p>An' two or three times he endeavoured to spake,</p>
<p>But the sthrong, manly voice used to falther and break;</p>
<p>But at last, by the strength of his high-mounting pride,</p>
<p>He conquered and masthered his grief's swelling tide,</p>
<p>"An'," says he, "mother, darlin', don't break your poor heart,</p>
<p>For, sooner or later, the dearest must part;</p>
<p>And <span class="sc">God</span> knows it's betther than wandering in fear</p>
<p>On the bleak, trackless mountain, among the wild deer,</p>
<p>To lie in the grave, where the head, heart, and breast,</p>
<p>From thought, labour, and sorrow, forever shall rest.</p>
<p>Then, mother, my darlin', don't cry any more,</p>
<p>Don't make me seem broken, in this, my last hour;</p>
<p>For I wish, when my head's lyin' undher the raven,</p>
<p>No thrue man can say that I died like a craven!"</p>
<p>Then towards the judge <span class="sc">Shamus</span> bent down his head,</p>
<p>An' that minute the solemn death-sentince was said.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>The mornin' was bright, an' the mists rose on high,</p>
<p>An' the lark whistled merrily in the clear sky;</p>
<p>But why are the men standin' idle so late?</p>
<p>An' why do the crowds gather fast in the street?</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page218" id="page218"></a>[page&nbsp;218]</span>
<p>What come they to talk of? what come they to see?</p>
<p>An' why does the long rope hang from the cross-tree?</p>
<p>O, <span class="sc">Shamus O'Brien</span>! pray fervent and fast,</p>
<p>May the saints take your soul, for this day is your last;</p>
<p>Pray fast an' pray sthrong, for the moment is nigh,</p>
<p>When, sthrong, proud, an' great as you are, you must die.</p>
<p>An' fasther an' fasther, the crowd gathered there,</p>
<p>Boys, horses, and gingerbread, just like a fair;</p>
<p>An' whiskey was sellin', and cussamuck too,</p>
<p>An' ould men and young women enjoying the view.</p>

<p>Sich divarshin and crowds, was known since the deluge,</p>

  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>At last they threw open the big prison-gate,</p>
<p>An' out came the sheriffs and sodgers in state,</p>
<p>An' a cart in the middle, an' <span class="sc">Shamus</span> was in it,</p>
<p>Not paler, but prouder than ever, that minute.</p>
<p>An' as soon as the people saw <span class="sc">Shamus O'Brien</span>,</p>
<p>Wid prayin' and blessin', and all the girls cryin',</p>
<p>A wild wailin' sound kem on by degrees,</p>
<p>Like the sound of the lonesome wind blowin' through trees.</p>
<p>On, on to the gallows the sheriffs are gone,</p>

<p>An' the priest, havin' blest him, goes down on the ground,</p>

<h2>"WHICH AM DE MIGHTIEST, DE PEN OR DE SWORD?"</h2>


<blockquote><p>
The "Colored Debating Society" of Mount Vernon, Ohio,
had some very interesting meetings. The object of the argument
on a particular evening was the settlement, at once and
forever, of the question.
</p></blockquote>

<p>Mr. Larkins said about as follows: "Mr. Chaarman,
what's de use ob a swoard unless you's gwyne
to waar? Who's hyar dat's gwyne to waar? I isn't,
Mr. Morehouse isn't, Mrs. Morehouse isn't, Mr.
Newsome isn't; I'll bet no feller wot speaks on the
swoard side is any ideer ob gwyne to waar. Den,
what's de use ob de swoard? I don't tink dar's
much show for argument in de matter."</p>

<p>Mr. Lewman said: "What's de use ob de pen
'less you knows how to write? How's dat? Dat's
what I wants to know. Look at de chillun ob
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page220" id="page220"></a>[page&nbsp;220]</span>
Isr'l&mdash;wasn't but one man in de whole crowd gwine up
from Egyp' to de Promis' Lan' cood write, an' he
didn't write much. [A voice in the audience, "Who
wrote de ten comman'ments, anyhow, you bet."
Cheers from the pen side.] Wrote 'em? wrote 'em?
Not much; guess not; not on stone, honey. Might
p'r'aps cut 'em wid a chisel. Broke 'em all, anyhow,
'fore he got down de hill. Den when he cut a
new set, de chillun ob Isr'l broke 'em all again. Say
he did write 'em, what good was it? So his pen no
'count nohow. No, saar. De <i>swoard's</i> what fotched
'em into de Promis' Lan', saar. Why, saar, it's
ridiculous. Tink, saar, ob David a-cuttin' off
Goliah's head wid a <i>pen</i>, saar! De ideer's altogedder
too 'posterous, saar. De <i>swoard</i>, saar, de
<i>swoard</i> mus' win de argument, saar."</p>

<p>Dr. Crane said: "I tink Mr. Lewman a leetle too
fas'. He's a-speakin' ob de times in de dim pas',
when de mind ob man was crude, an' de han' ob man
was in de ruff state, an' not tone down to de refinement
ob cibilized times. Dey wasn't educated up to
de use ob de pen. Deir han's was only fit for de ruff
use ob de swoard. Now, as de modern poet says,
our swoards rust in deir cubbards, an' peas, sweet
peas, cover de lan'. An' what has wrot all dis
change? <i>De pen.</i> Do I take a swoard now to get
me a peck ob sweet taters, a pair ob chickens, a pair
ob shoes? No, saar. I jess take my pen an' write
an order for 'em. Do I want money? I don't git it
by de edge ob de swoard; I writes a check. I want
a suit ob clothes, for instance&mdash;a stroke ob de pen,
de mighty pen, de clothes is on de way. I'se done."</p>

<p>Mr. Newsome said: "Wid all due 'spect to de
learned gemman dat's jus' spoke, we mus' all agree
dat for smoovin' tings off an' a-levelin' tings down,
dere's notting equals de swoard."</p>

<p>Mr. Hunnicut said: "I agrees entirely wid Mr.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page221" id="page221"></a>[page&nbsp;221]</span>
Newsome; an' in answer to what Dr. Crane says, I
would jess ask what's de use ob drawin' a check unless
you's got de money in de bank, or a-drawin' de
order on de store unless de store truss you? S'pose
de store do truss, ain't it easier to sen' a boy as to
write a order? If you got no boy handy, telegraf.
No use for a pen&mdash;not a bit. Who ebber heard of
Mr. Hill's pen? Nobody, saar. But his swoard,
saar&mdash;de swoard ob ole Bunker Hill, saar&mdash;is known
to ebbery chile in de lan'. If it hadden been for de
swoard ob ole Bunker Hill, saar, whaar'd we niggers
be to-night, saar? whaar, saar? Not hyar, saar.
In Georgia, saar, or wuss, saar. No cullud man,
saar, should ebber go back, saar, on de swoard,
saar."</p>

<p>Mr. Hunnicut's remarks seemed to carry a good
deal of weight with the audience. After speeches by
a number of others, the subject was handed over to
the "committee," who carried it out and "sot on
it." In due time they returned with the followin'
decision:</p>

<p>"De committee decide dat de swoard has de most
pints an' de best backin', an' dat de pen is de most
beneficial, an' dat de whole ting is about a stan'-off."</p>

<h2>JUVENILE PUGILISTS.</h2>

<p class="indright"><b>S. C. CLEMENS.</b></p>

<p style="line-height: 1%; margin-top: -0.5em;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="dropcap" ><span class="dcap">Y</span>
<b>ES</b>, I've had a good many fights in my time,"
said old John Parky, tenderly manipulating
his dismantled nose, "and it's kind of queer, too, for
when I was a boy the old man was always telling me
better. He was a good man and hated fighting.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page222" id="page222"></a>[page&nbsp;222]</span>
When I would come home with my nose bleeding or
with my face scratched up, he used to call me out in
the woodshed, and in a sorrowful and discouraged
way say, 'So, Johnny, you've had another fight,
hey? How many times have I got to tell ye how
disgraceful and wicked it is for boys to fight? It was
only yesterday that I talked to you an hour about the
sin of fighting, and here you've been at it again.
Who was it with this time? <i>With Tommy Kelly,
hey?</i> Don't you know any better than to fight a boy
that weighs twenty pounds more than you do, besides
being two years older? Ain't you got a spark of
sense about ye? I can see plainly that you are
determined to break your poor father's heart by your
reckless conduct. What ails your finger? <i>Tommy
bit it?</i> Drat the little fool! Didn't ye know enough
to keep your finger out of his mouth? <i>Was trying
to jerk his cheek off, hey?</i> Won't you never learn to
quit foolin' 'round a boy's mouth with yer fingers?
You're bound to disgrace us all by such wretched
behaviour. You're determined never to be nobody.
Did you ever hear of Isaac Watts&mdash;that wrote, "Let
dogs delight to bark and bite"&mdash;sticking his fingers
in a boy's mouth to get 'em bit, like a fool? I'm
clean discouraged with ye. Why didn't ye go for his
nose, the way Jonathan Edwards, and George Washington,
and Daniel Webster used to do, when they
was boys? <i>Couldn't 'cause he had ye down?</i> That's
a purty story to tell me. It does beat all that you
can't learn how Socrates and William Penn used to
gouge when they was under, after the hours and
hours I've spent in telling you about those great
men! It seems to me sometimes as if I should have
to give you up in despair. It's an awful trial to me
to have a boy that don't pay any attention to good
example, nor to what I say. What! <i>You pulled
out three or four handfuls of his hair?</i> H'm! Did
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page223" id="page223"></a>[page&nbsp;223]</span>
he squirm any? Now if you'd a give him one or two
in the eye&mdash;but as I've told ye many a time, fighting
is poor business. Won't you&mdash;for your <i>father's</i> sake&mdash;<i>won't
you</i> promise to try and remember that?
H'm! Johnny, how did it&mdash;ahem&mdash;which licked?"</p>

<p>"'<i>You licked him?</i> Sho! Really? Well, now,
I hadn't any idea you could lick that Tommy Kelly!
I don't believe John Bunyan, at ten years old, could
have done it. Johnny, my boy, you can't think how
I hate to have you fighting every day or two. I
wouldn't have had him lick <i>you</i> for five, no, not for
ten dollars! Now, sonny, go right in and wash up,
and tell your mother to put a rag on your finger.
And, Johnny, don't let me hear of your fighting
again!'"</p>

<p>"I never see anybody so down on fighting as the
old man, was, but somehow he never could break me
from it."</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<div class="figleft3">
W</div> <br style="line-height: 30%" />
<p class="i4">&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>ELL</b>, wife, I've been to church to-day&mdash;been to a stylish one&mdash;</p>
<p class="i6">And, seein' you can't go from home, I'll tell you what was done;</p>
<p>You would have been surprised to see what I saw there to-day;</p>
<p>The sisters were fixed up so fine they hardly bowed to pray.</p>
<p>I had on these coarse clothes of mine, not much the worse for wear,</p>
<p>But then they knew I wasn't one they call a millionaire;</p>
<p>So they led the old man to a seat away back by the door&mdash;</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page224" id="page224"></a>[page&nbsp;224]</span>
<p>'Twas bookless and uncushioned&mdash;<i>a reserved seat for the poor</i>.</p>
<p>Pretty soon in came a stranger with gold ring and clothing fine;</p>
<p>They led him to a cushioned seat far in advance of mine.</p>
<p>I thought that wasn't exactly right to seat him up so near,</p>
<p>When he was young, and I was old and very hard to hear.</p>
<p>But then there's no accountin' for what some people do;</p>
<p>The finest clothing nowadays oft gets the finest pew,</p>
<p>But when we reach the blessed home, all undefiled by sin,</p>
<p>We'll see wealth beggin' at the gate, while poverty goes in.</p>
<p>I couldn't hear the sermon, I sat so far away,</p>
<p>So, through the hours of service, I could only "watch and pray;"</p>
<p>Watch the doin's of the Christians sitting near me, round about;</p>
<p>Pray God to make them pure within, as they were pure without.</p>
<p>While I sat there, lookin' 'round upon the rich and great,</p>
<p>I kept thinkin' of the rich man and the beggar at his gate;</p>
<p>How, by all but dogs forsaken, the poor beggar's form grew cold,</p>
<p>And the angels bore his spirit to the mansions built of gold.</p>
<p>How, at last, the rich man perished, and his spirit took its flight,</p>
<p>From the purple and fine linen to the home of endless night;</p>
<p>There he learned, as he stood gazin' at the beggar in the sky,</p>
<p>"It isn't all of life to live, nor all of death to die."</p>
<p>I doubt not there were wealthy sires in that religious fold,</p>
<p>Who went up from their dwellings like the Pharisee of old,</p>
<p>Then returned home from their worship, with a head uplifted high,</p>
<p>To spurn the hungry from their door, with naught to satisfy.</p>
<p>Out, out with such professions! they are doin' more to-day</p>
<p>To stop the weary sinner from the Gospel's shinin' way</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page225" id="page225"></a>[page&nbsp;225]</span>
<p>Than all the books of infidels; than all that has been tried</p>
<p>Since Christ was born at Bethlehem&mdash;since Christ was crucified.</p>
<p>How simple are the works of God, and yet how very grand;</p>
<p>The shells in ocean caverns, the flowers on the land;</p>
<p>He gilds the clouds of evenin' with the gold right from his throne,</p>
<p>Not for the rich man <i>only</i>&mdash;not for the poor alone.</p>
<p>Then why should man look down on man because of lack of gold?</p>
<p>Why seat him in the poorest pew because his clothes are old?</p>
<p>A heart with noble motives&mdash;a heart that God has blest&mdash;</p>
<p>May be beatin' Heaven's music 'neath that faded coat and vest.</p>
<p>I'm old&mdash;I may be childish&mdash;but I love simplicity;</p>
<p>I love to see it shinin' in a Christian's piety.</p>
<p>Jesus told us in His sermons in Judea's mountains wild,</p>
<p>He that wants to go to Heaven must be like a little child.</p>
<p>Our heads are growin' gray, dear wife; our hearts are beatin' slow;</p>
<p>In a little while the Master will call us for to go.</p>
<p>When we reach the pearly gateways, and look in with joyful eyes,</p>
<p>We'll see <i>no stylish worship</i> in the temple of the skies.</p>

<p>The sexton didn't seat me away back by the door;</p>
<p>He knew that I was old and deaf, as well as old and poor;</p>
<p>He must have been a Christian, for he led me boldly through</p>
<p>The long isle of that crowded church to find a pleasant pew.</p>
<p>I wish you'd heard the singin'; it had the old-time ring;</p>
<p>The preacher said, with trumpet voice: "Let all the people sing!"</p>
<p>The tune was "Coronation," and the music upward rolled,</p>
<p>Till I thought I heard the angels striking all their harps of gold.</p>
<p>My deafness seemed to melt away; my spirit caught the fire;</p>
<p>I joined my feeble, trembling voice with that melodious choir,</p>
<p>And sang as in my youthful days: "Let angels prostrate fall;</p>
<p>Bring forth the royal diadem, and crown him Lord of all."</p>
<p>I tell you, wife, it did me good to sing that hymn once more;</p>
<p>I felt like some wrecked mariner who gets a glimpse of shore;</p>
<p>I almost wanted to lay down this weather-beaten form,</p>
<p>And anchor in that blessed port, forever from the storm.</p>
<p>The prechen'? Well, I can't just tell all that the preacher said;</p>
<p>I know it wasn't written; I know it wasn't read;</p>
<p>He hadn't time to read it, for the lightnin' of his eye</p>
<p>Went flashin' 'long from pew to pew, nor passed a sinner by.</p>
<p>The sermon wasn't flowery; 'twas simple Gospel truth;</p>
<p>It fitted poor old men like me; it fitted hopeful youth;</p>
<p>'Twas full of consolation for weary hearts that bleed;</p>
<p>'Twas full of invitations to Christ and not to creed.</p>
<p>The preacher made sin hideous in Gentiles and in Jews;</p>
<p>He shot the golden sentences down in the finest pews;</p>
<p>And&mdash;though I can't see very well&mdash;I saw the falling tear</p>
<p>That told me hell was some ways off, and heaven very near.</p>
<p>How swift the golden moments fled within that holy place;</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page227" id="page227"></a>[page&nbsp;227]</span>
<p>How brightly beamed the light of heaven from every happy face;</p>
<p>Again I longed for that sweet time when friend shall meet with friend,</p>
<p>"When congregations ne'er break up, and Sabbath has no end."</p>
<p>I hope to meet that minister&mdash;that congregation, too&mdash;</p>
<p>In that dear home beyond the stars that shine from heaven's blue;</p>
<p>I doubt not I'll remember, beyond life's evenin' gray,</p>
<p>The happy hour of worship in that model church to-day.</p>
<p>Dear wife, the fight will soon be fought&mdash;the victory soon be won;</p>
<p>The shinin' goal is just ahead; the race is nearly run;</p>
<p>O'er the river we are nearin', they are throngin' to the shore,</p>
<p>To shout our safe arrival where the weary weep no more.</p>

<h2>THE SAN FRANCISCO AUCTIONEER.</h2>

<p class="indright"><b>ANON.</b></p>

<p style="line-height: 1%; margin-top: -0.5em;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="dropcap" ><span class="dcap">N</span>
<b>OW</b>, ladies and gentlemen, I have the honour of
putting up a fine pocket-handkerchief, a yard
wide, a yard long, and almost a yard thick; one-half
cotton, and t'other half cotton too, beautifully printed
with stars and stripes on one side, and the stripes
and stars on t'other. It will wipe dust from the eyes
so completely as to be death to demagogues, and
make politics as bad a business as printing papers.
Its great length, breadth and thickness, together
with its dark colour, will enable it to hide dirt, and
never need washing. Going at one dollar? seventy-five
cents? fifty cents? twenty-five cents? one bit?
Nobody wants it! Oh, thank you, sir! Next, gentlemen&mdash;for
the ladies won't be permitted to bid on this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page228" id="page228"></a>[page&nbsp;228]</span>
article&mdash;is a real, simon pure, tempered, highly-polished,
keen-edged Sheffield razor; bran spanking
new; never opened before to sunlight, moonlight,
starlight, daylight or gaslight; sharp enough to
shave a lawyer or cut a disagreeable acquaintance or
poor relation; handle of buck-horn, with all the
rivets but the two at the ends of pure gold. Who
will give two dollars? one dollar? half a dollar?
Why, ye long-bearded, dirty-faced reprobates, with
not room on your phizzes for a Chinese woman to
kiss, I'm offering you a bargain at half a dollar!
Well, I'll throw in this strop at half a dollar! razor
and strop! a recent patent; two rubs upon it will
sharpen the city attorney; all for four bits; and a
piece of soap, sweeter than roses, lathers better than
a school-master, and strong enough to wash all the
stains from a California politician's countenance, all
for four bits. Why, you have only to put the razor,
strop and soap under your pillow at night, and wake
up in the morning clean shaved. Won't anybody
give two bits, then, for the lot? I knew I would sell
them! Next, ladies and gentlemen, I offer three
pair socks, hose, stockings, or half-hose, just as
you're a mind to call them, knit by a machine made
on purpose, out of cotton wool. The man that buys
these will be enabled to walk till he gets tired; and,
provided his boots are big enough, needn't have any
corns; the legs are as long as bills against the corporation,
and as thick as the heads of the members
of the legislature. Who wants 'em at one half
dollar? Thank-ee, madame, the money. Next I
offer you a pair of boots made especially for San
Francisco, with heels long enough to raise a man up
to the Hoadley grades, and nails to ensure against
being carried over by a land slide; legs wide enough
to carry two revolvers and a bowie-knife, and the
upper of the very best horse leather. A man in these
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page229" id="page229"></a>[page&nbsp;229]</span>
boots can move about as easy as the State Capitol.
Who says twenty dollars? All the tax-payers ought
to buy a pair to kick the council with, everybody
ought to buy a pair to kick the legislature with, and
they will be found of assistance in kicking the bucket
especially if somebody should kick at being kicked.
Ten dollars for legs, uppers and soles! while souls,
and miserable souls at that, are bringing twenty
thousand dollars in Sacramento! Ten dollars! ten
dollars! gone at ten dollars! Next is something
that you ought to have, gentlemen,&mdash;a lot of good
gallowses&mdash;sometimes called suspenders. I know
that some of you will, after a while, be furnished at
the State's expense, but you can't tell which one, so
buy where they're cheap. All that deserve to be
hanged are not supplied with a gallows; if so, there
would be nobody to make laws, condemn criminals,
or hang culprits, until a new election. Made of pure
gum-elastic&mdash;stretch like a judge's conscience, and
last as long as a California office-holder will steal;
buckles of pure iron, and warranted to hold so tight
that no man's wife can rob him of his breeches; are,
in short, as strong, as good, as perfect, as effectual
and as bona-fide as the ordinance against Chinese
shops on Dupont Street&mdash;gone at twenty-five cents.</p>

<h2>PAT-ENT GUN.</h2>


<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<div class="figleft3">
I</div> <br style="line-height: 30%" />
<p class="i2"><b>'VE</b> heard a good joke on Emerald Pat,</p>
<p class="i4">Who kept a few brains and a brick in his hat;</p>
<p>He was bound to go hunting; so taking his gun</p>
<p>He rammed down a charge&mdash;this was load number one;</p>
<p>Then he put in the priming, and when all was done,</p>
<p>By way of experiment, he thought he would try</p>
<p>And see if by perchance he might hit the "bull's eye."</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page230" id="page230"></a>[page&nbsp;230]</span>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>He straightened himself until he made a good figure,</p>
<p>Took a deliberate aim and then pulled the trigger.</p>
<p>Click! went the hammer, but nothing exploded;</p>
<p>"And sure," muttered Paddy, "the gun isn't loaded."</p>
<p>So down went another charge, just as before,</p>
<p>Unless this contained a grain or two more;</p>
<p>Once more he made ready and took a good aim</p>
<p>And pulled on the trigger&mdash;effect quite the same.</p>
<p>"I wonder, can this be, still shootin'?" said Pat;</p>
<p>"I put down a load, now I'm certain of that;</p>
<p>I'll try it again, and then we shall see!"</p>
<p>So down went the cartridge of load number three.</p>
<p>Then trying again with a confident air,</p>
<p>And succeeding no better, he gave up in despair.</p>
<p>Just at that moment he happened to spy</p>
<p>His friend, Michael Milligan, hurrying by.</p>
<p>"Hello, Mike! Come here and try on my gun;</p>
<p>I've been trying to shoot until I'm tired and done!"</p>
<p>So Mike took the gun and picked up the powder,</p>
<p>Remarking to Pat, "it would make it go louder."</p>
<p>Then placing it firmly against his right arm,</p>
<p>And never suspecting it might do him harm,</p>
<p>He pointed the piece in the proper direction,</p>
<p>And pulled on the trigger without more reflection,</p>
<p>When off went the gun like a county election</p>
<p>Where whisky and gin have exclusive selection</p>
<p>Of those who are chosen to guard the inspection&mdash;</p>
<p>There's a great deal of noise&mdash;and some little inspection,</p>
<p>And Michael "went off" in another direction.</p>
<p>"Hold on!" shouted Pat, "Hold on to the gun,</p>
<p>I put in three loads, and you fired off but one!</p>
<p>Get up, and be careful, don't hold it so level,</p>
<p>Or else we are both us gone to the&mdash;cemetery!"</p>
<p>"I'm goin'," says Michael, "it's time that I wint,</p>
<p>I've got meself kicked and I'll just take the hint."</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>Now, old boys, and young, here's a moral for you;</p>
<p>Don't make Pat your pattern whatever you do.</p>
<p>Don't carry too much in the crown of your hat;</p>
<p>Of all things you lodge there beware of the bat!</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page231" id="page231"></a>[page&nbsp;231]</span>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>I don't mean the little mouse flying in the air,</p>
<p>The ladies so fear that may get into their hair,</p>
<p>But the dangerous brick bat, so much worse than that,</p>
<p>Nobody can wear it that isn't a "flat,"</p>
<p>And then don't forget it is one of Old Nick's</p>
<p>Diabolical methods of playing his tricks</p>
<p>On foolish young men who become "perfect bricks;"</p>
<p>He don't give the hint until <i>after</i> he kicks!</p>

<b>LL</b> worldly shapes shall melt in gloom, the sun
himself must die, before this mortal shall assume
its immortality! I saw a vision in my sleep
that gave my spirit strength to sweep adown the gulf
of Time! I saw the last of human mould that shall
Creation's death behold, as Adam saw her prime!
The Sun's eye had a sickly glare, the earth with age
was wan; the skeletons of nations were around that
lonely man! Some had expired in fight&mdash;the brands
still rusted in their bony hands; in plague and
famine some. Earth's cities had no sound or tread,
and ships were drifting with the dead to shores
where all was dumb. Yet, prophet-like, that Lone
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page233" id="page233"></a>[page&nbsp;233]</span>
One stood, with dauntless words and high, that
shook the sere leaves from the wood as if a storm
passed by, saying&mdash;"We are twins in death, proud
Sun! thy face is cold, thy race is run, 'tis mercy bids
thee go; for thou ten thousand years hast seen the
tide of human tears&mdash;that shall no longer flow.
What though beneath thee, man put forth his pomp,
his pride, his skill; and arts that made fire, flood,
and earth, the vassals of his will?&mdash;yet mourn I not
thy parted sway, thou dim, discrown&egrave;d king of day;
for all those trophied arts and triumphs, that beneath
thee sprang, healed not a passion or a pang entailed
on human hearts. Go! let Oblivion's curtain fall
upon the stage of men! nor with thy rising beams
recall life's tragedy again! Its piteous pageants
bring not back, nor waken flesh upon the rack of pain
anew to writhe, stretched in Disease's shapes abhorred,
or mown in battle by the sword, like grass
beneath the scythe! Even I am weary in yon skies
to watch thy fading fire: test of all sumless agonies,
behold not me expire! My lips, that speak thy dirge
of death, their rounded gasp and gurgling breath to
see, thou shalt not boast; the eclipse of Nature
spreads my pall, the majesty of Darkness shall
receive my parting ghost! The spirit shall return to
Him who gave its heavenly spark; yet think not,
Sun, it shall be dim when thou thyself art dark! No!
it shall live again, and shine in bliss unknown to
beams of thine; by Him recalled to breath, who captive
led captivity, who robbed the grave of victory,
and took the sting from Death! Go, Sun, while
mercy holds me up on Nature's awful waste, to drink
this last and bitter cup of grief that man shall taste,&mdash;go!
tell the night that hides thy face thou saw'st
the last of Adam's race on earth's sepulchral clod,
the darkening universe defy to quench his immortality,
or shake his trust in God!"</p>

<p>Quick to his mother's side he sprang,</p>
<p>And on the air his clear voice rang:</p>
<p>"Up, mother, up! I'm free! I'm free!</p>
<p>The choice was death or slavery.</p>
<p>Up, mother, up! Look on thy son!</p>

<p>To bear his father home in bliss&mdash;</p>
<p>One last embrace, one blessing&mdash;one!</p>
<p>To prove thou knowest, approvest thy son.</p>
<p>What! silent yet? Canst thou not feel</p>
<p>My warm blood o'er my heart congeal?</p>

<h2>THAT HIRED GIRL.</h2>

<p class="indright"><b>ANON.</b></p>

<p style="line-height: 1%; margin-top: -0.5em;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="dropcap" ><span class="dcap">W</span>
<b>HEN</b> she came to work for the family on Congress
street, the lady of the house sat down
and told her that agents, book-peddlers, hat-rack
men, picture sellers, ash-buyers, rag-men, and all
that class of people, must be met at the front door
and coldly repulsed, and Sarah said she'd repulse
them if she had to break every broomstick in
Detroit.</p>

<p>And she did. She threw the door open wide,
bluffed right up at 'em, and when she got through
talking, the cheekiest agent was only too glad to
leave. It got so after awhile that peddlers marked
that house, and the door-bell never rang except for
company.</p>

<p>The other day, as the girl of the house was wiping
off the spoons, the bell rang. She hastened to the
door, expecting to see a lady, but her eyes encountered
a slim man, dressed in black and wearing a
white necktie. He was the new minister, and was
going around to get acquainted with the members of
his flock, but Sarah wasn't expected to know this.</p>

<p>"Ah&mdash;um&mdash;is&mdash;Mrs.&mdash;ah!"</p>

<p>"Git!" exclaimed Sarah, pointing to the gate.</p>

<p>"Beg pardon, but I would like to see&mdash;see&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Meander!" she shouted, looking around for a
weapon; "we don't want any flour-sifters here!"</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page242" id="page242"></a>[page&nbsp;242]</span>

<p>"You're mistaken," he replied, smiling blandly.
"I called to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't want anything to keep moths away&mdash;fly!"
she exclaimed, getting red in the face.</p>

<p>"Is the lady in?" he inquired, trying to look over
Sarah's head.</p>

<p>"Yes, the lady is in, and I'm in, and you are out!"
she snapped; "and now I don't want to stand here
talking to a fly-trap agent any longer! Come lift
your boots!"</p>

<p>"I'm not an agent," he said, trying to smile.
"I'm the new&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, I know you&mdash;you are the new man with the
patent flat-iron, but we don't want any, and you'd
better go before I call the dog."</p>

<p>"Will you give the lady my card, and say that I
called?"</p>

<p>"No, I won't; we are bored to death with cards
and handbills and circulars. Come, I can't stand
here all day."</p>

<p>"Didn't you know that I was a minister?" he
asked as he backed off.</p>

<p>"No, nor I don't know it now; you look like the
man who sold the woman next door a dollar chromo
for eighteen shillings."</p>

<p>"But here is my card."</p>

<p>"I don't care for cards, I tell you! If you leave
that gate open I will have to fling a flower-pot at
you!"</p>

<p>"I will call again," he said, as he went through
the gate.</p>

<p>"It won't do any good!" she shouted after him;
"we don't want no prepared food for infants&mdash;no piano
music&mdash;no stuffed birds! I know the policemen on
this beat, and if you come around here again, he'll
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page243" id="page243"></a>[page&nbsp;243]</span>
soon find out whether you are a confidence man or a
vagrant!"</p>

<p>And she took unusual care to lock the door.</p>

<h2>THE HYPOCHONDRIAC.</h2>

<p style="line-height: 1%; margin-top: -0.5em;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="dropcap" ><span class="dcap">G</span>
<b>OOD</b> morning, Doctor; how do you do? I haint
quite so well as I have been; but I think I'm
some better than I was. I don't think that last
medicine you gin me did me much good. I had
a terrible time with the ear-ache last night; my
wife got up and drapt a few draps of Walnut sap
into it, and that relieved it some; but I didn't get
a wink of sleep till nearly daylight. For nearly a
week, Doctor, I've had the worst kind of a narvous
head-ache; it has been so bad sometimes that I
thought my head would bust open. Oh, dear! I
sometimes think that I'm the most afflictedest
human that ever lived.</p>

<p>Since this cold weather sot in, that troublesome
cough, that I have had every winter for the last
fifteen year, has began to pester me agin.</p>

<p>(<i>Coughs.</i>)&nbsp;&nbsp;Doctor, do you think you can give me
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page248" id="page248"></a>[page&nbsp;248]</span>
anything that will relieve this desprit pain I have
in my side?</p>

<p>Then I have a crick, at times, in the back of my
neck so that I can't turn my head without turning
the hull of my body. &nbsp;&nbsp;(<i>Coughs.</i>)</p>

<p>Oh, dear! What shall I do! I have consulted
almost every doctor in the country, but they don't
any of them seem to understand my case. I have
tried everything that I could think of; but I can't
find anything that does me the leastest good.
&nbsp;&nbsp;(<i>Coughs.</i>)</p>

<p>Oh this cough&mdash;it will be the death of me yet!
You know I had my right hip put out last fall at
the rising of Deacon Jones' saw mill; its getting
to be very troublesome just before we have a change
of weather. Then I've got the sciatica in my right
knee, and sometimes I'm so crippled up that I can
hardly crawl round in any fashion.</p>

<p>What do you think that old white mare of ours
did while I was out plowing last week? Why, the
weacked old critter, she kept a backing and backing,
on till she back'd me right up agin the colter,
and knock'd a piece of skin off my shin nearly so
big. &nbsp;&nbsp;(<i>Coughs.</i>)</p>

<p>But I had a worse misfortune than that the other
day, Doctor. You see it was washing-day&mdash;and my
wife wanted me to go out and bring in a little stove-wood&mdash;you
know we lost our help lately, and my
wife has to wash and tend to everything about the
house herself.</p>

<p>I knew it wouldn't be safe for me to go out&mdash;as
it was a raining at the time&mdash;but I thought I'd risk
it any how. So I went out, pick'd up a few chunks
of stove-wood, and was a coming up the steps into
the house, when my feet slipp'd from under me,
and I fell down as sudden as if I'd been shot. Some
of the wood lit upon my face, broke down the bridge
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page249" id="page249"></a>[page&nbsp;249]</span>
of my nose, cut my upper lip, and knock'd out three
of my front teeth. I suffered dreadfully on account
of it, as you may suppose, and my face ain't well
enough yet to make me fit to be seen, specially by
the women folks. &nbsp;&nbsp;(<i>Coughs.</i>) &nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, dear! but that
ain't all, Doctor, I've got fifteen corns on my toes&mdash;and
I'm afeard I'm a going to have the "yallar
janders." &nbsp;&nbsp;(<i>Coughs.</i>)</p>

seriously infringe upon the rules of etiquette;&mdash;in
your own house act as you please; but in mine, for
this once please me."</p>

<p>Every eye was turned towards the bridal pair.
Marion's principles were well known. Henry had
been a convivialist, but of late his friends noticed
the change in his manners, the difference in his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page251" id="page251"></a>[page&nbsp;251]</span>
habits&mdash;and to-night they watched him to see, as
they sneeringly said, if he was tied down to a
woman's opinion so soon.</p>

<p>Pouring a brimming beaker, they held it with
tempting smiles toward Marion. She was very
pale, though more composed, and her hand shook
not, as smiling back, she gratefully accepted the
crystal tempter and raised it to her lips. But
scarcely had she done so when every hand was
arrested by her piercing exclamation of "Oh, how
terrible!" "What is it?" cried one and all, thronging
together, for she had slowly carried the glass at
arm's length, and was fixedly regarding it as though
it were some hideous object.</p>

<p>"Wait," she answered, while an inspired light
shone from her dark eyes, "wait and I will tell you.
I see," she added, slowly pointing one jewelled
finger at the sparkling ruby liquid, "A sight that
beggars all description; and yet listen; I will paint
it for you if I can: It is a lonely spot; tall
mountains, crowned with verdure, rise in awful
sublimity around; a river runs through, and bright
flowers grow to the waters' edge. There is a thick,
warm mist that the sun seeks vainly to pierce;
trees, lofty and beautiful, wave to the airy motion
of the birds; but there, a group of Indians gather;
they flit to and fro with something like sorrow upon
their dark brow; and in their midst lies a manly
form, but his cheek, how deathly; his eye wild
with the fitful fire of fever. One friend stands beside
him, nay, I should say kneels, for he is pillowing
that poor head upon his breast.</p>

<p>"Genius in ruins. Oh! the high, holy looking
brow! Why should death mark it, and he so
young? Look how he throws the damp curls! see
him clasp his hands! hear his thrilling shrieks
for life! mark how he clutches at the form of his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page252" id="page252"></a>[page&nbsp;252]</span>
companion, imploring to be saved. Oh! hear him
call piteously his father's name; see him twine
his fingers, together as he shrieks for his sister&mdash;his
only sister&mdash;the twin of his soul&mdash;weeping for him
in his distant native land.</p>

<p>"See!" she exclaimed, while the bridal party
shrank back, the untasted wine trembling in their
faltering grasp, and the Judge fell, overpowered,
upon his seat; "see! his arms are lifted to heaven;
he prays, how wildly, for mercy! hot fever rushes
through his veins. The friend beside him is weeping;
awe-stricken, the men move silently, and leave
the living and dying together."</p>

<p>There was a hush in that princely parlor, broken
only by what seemed a smothered sob, from some
manly bosom. The bride stood yet upright, with
quivering lip, and tears stealing to the outward edge
of her lashes. Her beautiful arm had lost its
tension, and the glass, with its little troubled red
waves, came slowly towards the range of her
vision. She spoke again; every lip was mute.
Her voice was low, faint, yet awfully distinct: she
still fixed her sorrowful glance upon the wine-cup.</p>

<p>"It is evening now; the great white moon is
coming up, and her beams lay gently on his
forehead. He moves not; his eyes are set in their
sockets; dim are their piercing glances; in vain
his friend whispers the name of father and sister&mdash;death
is there. Death! and no soft hand, no
gentle voice to bless and soothe him. His head
sinks back! one convulsive shudder! he is dead!"</p>

<p>A groan ran through the assembly, so vivid
was her description, so unearthly her look, so
inspired her manner, that what she described
seemed actually to have taken place then and there.
They noticed also, that the bridegroom hid his
face in his hands and was weeping.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page253" id="page253"></a>[page&nbsp;253]</span>

<p>"Dead!" she repeated again, her lips quivering
faster and faster, and her voice more and more
broken; "and there they scoop him a grave; and
there without a shroud, they lay him down in the
damp reeking earth. The only son of a proud
father, the only idolized brother of a fond sister.
And he sleeps to-day in that distant country, with
no stone to mark the spot. There he lies&mdash;my
father's son&mdash;my own twin brother! a victim to
this deadly poison. Father," she exclaimed, turning
suddenly, while the tears rained down her beautiful
cheeks, "father, shall I drink it now?"</p>

<p>The form of the old Judge was convulsed with
agony. He raised his head, but in a smothered
voice he faltered&mdash;"No, no, my child, in God's
name, no."</p>

<p>She lifted the glittering goblet, and letting it
suddenly fall to the floor it was dashed into a
thousand pieces. Many a tearful eye watched her
movements, and instantaneously every wine-glass
was transferred to the marble table on which it had
been prepared. Then, as she looked at the
fragments of crystal, she turned to the company,
saying:&mdash;"Let no friend, hereafter, who loves me,
tempt me to peril my soul for wine. Not firmer
the everlasting hills than my resolve, God helping
me, never to touch or taste that terrible poison.
And he to whom I have given my hand; who
watched over my brother's dying form in that last
solemn hour, and buried the dear wanderer there
by the river in that land of gold, will, I trust, sustain
me in that resolve. Will you not, my husband?"</p>

<p>His glistening eyes, his sad, sweet smile was
her answer.</p>

<p>The Judge left the room, and when an hour later
he returned, and with a more subdued manner
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page254" id="page254"></a>[page&nbsp;254]</span>
took part in the entertainment of the bridal guests,
no one could fail to read that he, too, had
determined to dash the enemy at once and forever
from his princely rooms.</p>

<p>Those who were present at that wedding, can
never forget the impression so solemnly made.
Many from that hour forswore the social glass.</p>
